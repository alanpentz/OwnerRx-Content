# Inventory Management Complete Playbook
*Turn Dead Stock into Cash Flow*

## Executive Summary

Inventory is where cash goes to die. The average small business has 20-30% of its working capital trapped in slow-moving or obsolete inventory, yet most owners treat inventory management as an afterthought. Poor inventory management doesn't just tie up cash—it destroys margins through stockouts (lost sales), overstock (markdowns), and waste (obsolescence).

This playbook will transform your inventory from a necessary evil into a competitive advantage. You'll learn to predict demand accurately, optimize stock levels scientifically, and free up thousands in trapped cash. By mastering these strategies, you'll increase inventory turns by 25-40%, reduce carrying costs by 15-25%, and eliminate 90% of stockouts.

The transformation ahead: From reactive ordering based on gut feel to predictive inventory optimization that maximizes cash flow while ensuring you never miss a sale. These aren't theoretical concepts—these are battle-tested systems that have saved businesses from bankruptcy and fueled explosive growth.

## 1. TACTIC IDENTIFICATION

### Why Inventory Breaks Businesses

**The Working Capital Death Spiral:**
You buy inventory with cash → inventory sits unsold → cash remains trapped → you need more cash for operations → you discount inventory to generate cash → margins erode → you need more volume → you buy more inventory → cycle repeats until bankruptcy.

**The Three Inventory Killers:**

**Overstock Disease**: Buying too much of the wrong items
- Ties up cash in dead stock
- Increases storage costs
- Forces margin-killing markdowns
- Creates operational complexity

**Stockout Syndrome**: Running out of fast-moving items
- Lost sales (immediate revenue loss)
- Customer defection (lifetime value loss)
- Rush shipping costs (margin erosion)
- Reputation damage (future sales loss)

**Inventory Blindness**: Not knowing what you have, where it is, or when to reorder
- Duplicate ordering
- Lost/misplaced inventory
- Expired/obsolete products
- Panic purchasing decisions

### The Hidden Costs

**Carrying Costs: The Silent Killer**
- Storage: 3-5% of inventory value annually
- Insurance: 1-2% of inventory value
- Obsolescence: 5-10% write-offs annually
- Opportunity cost: 10-15% (cash could earn elsewhere)
- **Total: 20-30% of inventory value per year**

This means $100,000 in inventory costs you $20,000-$30,000 annually just to hold.

### The Optimization Opportunity

Companies with optimized inventory management achieve:
- 25-40% increase in inventory turnover
- 15-25% reduction in carrying costs
- 50-70% reduction in stockouts
- 20-30% improvement in gross margins
- 30-50% reduction in working capital requirements

## 3. ALAN'S INSIGHTS

### Core Inventory Principles

**"Your inventory should turn like milk, not wine"**
Unless you're literally selling wine, aging inventory doesn't improve its value—it destroys it. Every day inventory sits is a day your cash can't work elsewhere. Target turning your entire inventory 6-12 times per year minimum. If items sit longer than 90 days, they're not inventory—they're expensive decorations.

**"Stock what sells, not what you think might sell"**
The biggest inventory mistake is buying based on hope rather than data. Your purchasing should be driven by historical sales data, not supplier deals or gut feelings. That "great deal" on 1,000 units isn't great if you only sell 10 per month.

**"ABC or die—not all inventory is created equal"**
20% of your SKUs generate 80% of revenue. These 'A' items deserve daily attention, premium shelf space, and buffer stock. 'C' items (bottom 50% of SKUs) should be eliminated or made-to-order. Focus your energy where it matters.

### Additional Inventory Wisdom

- **Cash is king, inventory is prison**: Every dollar in inventory is a dollar not available for growth
- **Measure in days, not dollars**: Days of inventory tells the real story
- **Suppliers are banks**: Use vendor credit as free financing
- **Technology is cheap, stockouts are expensive**: Invest in systems before it hurts
- **Dead stock is cancer**: Cut it out immediately, regardless of the loss

## 4. ABC ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### Classification System

**A Items (Top 20% of SKUs = 80% of Revenue)**
- Daily monitoring
- Sophisticated forecasting
- Never stock out
- Premium storage location
- Multiple suppliers if possible
- 99.5% availability target

**B Items (Middle 30% of SKUs = 15% of Revenue)**
- Weekly monitoring
- Basic forecasting
- Moderate safety stock
- Standard storage
- Primary supplier with backup
- 95% availability target

**C Items (Bottom 50% of SKUs = 5% of Revenue)**
- Monthly monitoring
- Minimal or no stock
- Make-to-order when possible
- Remote storage
- Single supplier
- 85% availability target

### Implementation Steps

1. **Export 12 months of sales data by SKU**
2. **Calculate annual revenue per SKU**
3. **Sort by revenue (high to low)**
4. **Calculate cumulative revenue percentage**
5. **Assign ABC categories based on breaks**

## 6. REORDER POINT CALCULATIONS

### Basic Formula

```
Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
```

### Safety Stock Calculation

```
Safety Stock = Z-Score × √Lead Time × Standard Deviation of Demand

Where Z-Scores are:
- 90% service level = 1.28
- 95% service level = 1.65
- 99% service level = 2.33
```

### Practical Examples

**Example 1: Steady Demand Product**
- Average daily sales: 10 units
- Lead time: 7 days
- Desired service level: 95%
- Demand standard deviation: 3 units

Reorder Point = (10 × 7) + (1.65 × √7 × 3) = 70 + 13 = 83 units

**Example 2: Variable Demand Product**
- Average daily sales: 5 units
- Lead time: 14 days
- Desired service level: 99%
- Demand standard deviation: 4 units

Reorder Point = (5 × 14) + (2.33 × √14 × 4) = 70 + 35 = 105 units

### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

```
EOQ = √(2 × Annual Demand × Order Cost) / Holding Cost per Unit

Example:
- Annual demand: 1,000 units
- Order cost: $50
- Holding cost: $5 per unit/year

EOQ = √(2 × 1,000 × 50) / 5 = √20,000 = 141 units per order
```

## 7. INVENTORY METRICS DASHBOARD

### Key Performance Indicators

**Inventory Turnover Ratio**
```
Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
Target: 6-12 turns per year (varies by industry)
```

**Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)**
```
DIO = (Average Inventory / COGS) × 365
Target: 30-60 days (lower is better)
```

**Stockout Rate**
```
Stockout Rate = # of Stockouts / Total SKUs
Target: <2% for A items, <5% for B items
```

**Carrying Cost Percentage**
```
Carrying Cost % = Total Carrying Costs / Average Inventory Value
Target: <25% annually
```

**Gross Margin Return on Investment (GMROI)**
```
GMROI = Gross Margin $ / Average Inventory Cost
Target: >200% (2.0)
```

## 8. DEMAND FORECASTING

### Forecasting Methods by Business Type

**Steady Demand (Moving Average)**
```
Forecast = (Sales Month 1 + Month 2 + Month 3) / 3

Best for: Stable products, mature markets
Accuracy: 70-80%
```

**Trending Demand (Exponential Smoothing)**
```
Forecast = α × Actual + (1-α) × Previous Forecast
Where α = smoothing constant (0.1-0.3)

Best for: Growing/declining products
Accuracy: 75-85%
```

**Seasonal Demand (Seasonal Index)**
```
Seasonal Index = Period Sales / Average Period Sales
Forecast = Base Forecast × Seasonal Index

Best for: Holiday, weather-dependent items
Accuracy: 80-90%
```

### Forecast Accuracy Measurement

**Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
```
MAPE = (Σ|Actual - Forecast|/Actual) / n × 100

Interpretation:
<10% = Excellent
10-20% = Good
20-30% = Acceptable
>30% = Poor
```

### New Product Forecasting

**Similar Product Method:**
1. Identify similar product launches
2. Analyze their first 90-day sales curve
3. Adjust for market differences
4. Apply conservative factor (70-80%)

**Market Testing Method:**
1. Launch with minimal inventory
2. Track daily sales for 2 weeks
3. Project forward with growth factor
4. Adjust weekly based on actuals

## 9. SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT

**Scoring Scale:**
- 95-100%: Preferred partner
- 85-94%: Acceptable
- 75-84%: Needs improvement
- <75%: Consider replacement

### Negotiation Strategies

**Volume Commitments:**
"If we commit to X units annually, what discount can you offer?"

**Payment Terms:**
"We'll pay in 10 days for 2% discount, or standard net 60"

**Consignment Programs:**
"We'll give you premium shelf space for 60-day payment terms"

**Minimum Order Reductions:**
"Lower the minimum to X and we'll order 50% more frequently"

### Backup Supplier Strategy

**Critical Items (A-Items):**
- Primary supplier: 70% of volume
- Secondary supplier: 30% of volume
- Keep both relationships active

**Standard Items (B-Items):**
- Primary supplier: 90% of volume
- Backup identified but not active
- Annual quote comparison

**Commodity Items (C-Items):**
- Single supplier fine
- Spot market purchases acceptable
- Focus on price only
