## Universal Business Insights by Pillar

## PERSONAL VISION

### 1. The Money Guilt Complex
**The Internal Conflict:** Successful founder feeling "dirty" about financial goals

- "But I want $5M... it seems dirty"

**The Reality Check:**
- Money is byproduct, not goal
- Purpose drives profit
- Do what energizes you, money follows

**Coach's Reframe:** "If money is your only goal, you will not be happy because there's always more money"

### 7. The Leadership Crisis Cascade
**When a Key Leader Cracks**

**The Breaking Point:**

## FINANCE

### 12. The Profitability vs Growth Dilemma
**Why $20M at Wrong Margins is Dangerous**

**Too Many Projects, No Progress**
