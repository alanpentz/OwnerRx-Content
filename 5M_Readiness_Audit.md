# The $5M Readiness Audit
*40 Metrics That Predict Your Breakthrough (15-Minute Assessment)*

## Stop Guessing. Start Knowing.

You're stuck at $2-3M wondering why growth stalled. The answer is in these 40 metrics based on analysis of businesses that successfully broke through to $5M+. This isn't theory—it's what actually separates those who scale from those who plateau.

**The Second-Stage Reality:** You're not a startup anymore, but you're not enterprise either. You need the right metrics for businesses with 10-99 employees transitioning from owner-hero to systematic growth.

## THE TRUTH ABOUT $5M

**It's not about working harder.** Every business stuck at $2-3M has an owner working 60+ hours.

**It's about three transitions:**
1. Owner as coach, not player
2. Systems that scale, not hero efforts  
3. Team that can execute without you

**The businesses that break through to $5M aren't better—they measure better, systemize better, and delegate better.**

Your score tells you exactly where to start.
