# Sales Compensation & Incentives Complete Playbook
## Pay for Performance Without Going Broke

### Executive Summary: Commission Plans Are Where Good Intentions Meet Human Nature

Every business owner learns the same painful lesson: salespeople will do exactly what you pay them to do—nothing more, nothing less. Your compensation plan is your true sales strategy. Get it wrong, and you'll either go broke paying commissions or go broke from no sales.

**Alan's Core Philosophy:** "I've tried every compensation model. They all get gamed. The secret isn't finding the perfect plan—it's understanding that people optimize for their paycheck, then designing accordingly. And never, ever give equity to salespeople."

This playbook shows you how to design, implement, and optimize sales compensation that drives the right behaviors without destroying margins or creating monsters.

## The Compensation Reality

### Why Most Sales Comp Plans Fail

#### The "Set and Forget" Disaster
**The Mistake:** Create plan once, never adjust
**The Reality:** Markets change, reps game the system
**Alan's Experience:** "My first comp plan paid for quantity. Reps sold garbage deals that all churned. Nearly killed the company."

#### The Complexity Trap
**The Mistake:** 15 variables, accelerators, SPIFFs, tiers
**The Reality:** Reps can't calculate earnings, give up
**The Rule:** If you need a spreadsheet to explain it, it's too complex

#### The Equity Giveaway
**The Fatal Error:** Giving equity to salespeople
**Alan's Warning:** "Never give equity to salespeople. They'll optimize for personal exit, not company building. I've seen it destroy companies."

### The Psychology of Sales Compensation

> **Universal Business Insight #29: Commitment vs Transaction Psychology**
> 
> **Problem:** Transactional relationships create churn
> 
> Frame offerings as programs, not sessions. Require upfront commitment. Build in milestones and celebrate completions. Result: 2-3x better retention, improved cash flow, higher customer success rates.
> 
> **Universal Truth:** "Commitment creates value. Transactions create churn."

**What Salespeople Really Want:**
1. Uncapped earning potential
2. Clear path to earnings
3. Fast payment cycles
4. Predictable base
5. Fair territory/leads

**What Actually Motivates:**
- Public recognition (70%)
- Money (60%)
- Competition (50%)
- Career advancement (40%)
- Job security (30%)

## Implementation by Revenue Stage

### Solo/Bootstrap Stage ($0-1M)
**You Are the Sales Team**

**Compensation Reality:**
- Can't afford full-time salespeople
- Need commission-only or very low base
- Must be simple to administer
- Mistakes are catastrophic

**Bootstrap Compensation Models:**

**Option 1: Commission-Only**
```
Structure: 20-30% of collected revenue
Pros: No risk, pure performance
Cons: Hard to attract talent
Best for: Proven product, short sales cycle
```

**Option 2: Low Base + Commission**
```
Structure: $2-3K base + 10-15% commission
Pros: Attracts better talent
Cons: Cash flow risk
Best for: Longer sales cycle, complex sale
```

**Option 3: Graduated Commission**
```
0-$10K: 10%
$10-25K: 15%
$25K+: 20%
Pros: Rewards performance
Cons: More complex
Best for: Building momentum
```

**Alan's Bootstrap Wisdom:**
"Pay commission on collected cash, not signed contracts. You can't pay bills with receivables."

### Resourced Stage ($1M-5M)
**Building a Real Sales Team**

**Compensation Evolution:**
- Can afford base salaries
- Need professional salespeople
- Multiple comp plans possible
- Retention becomes important

**Standard Compensation Structure:**
```
Base: $40-60K (40-60% of OTE)
Commission: 8-12% of revenue
OTE: $80-120K
Accelerators: 15% above quota
```

**Quota Setting Formula:**
OTE × 5 = Annual Quota
Example: $100K OTE = $500K quota

**Key Components:**
- **Ramp Period:** 3-6 months at 50-75% quota
- **Draw Option:** Recoverable or non-recoverable
- **Clawbacks:** For deals that cancel early
- **Territories:** Geographic or vertical
- **House Accounts:** Clear rules on ownership

**Alan's $2M Insight:**
"At $2M, you need hunters. Pay them to hunt. Don't complicate it with customer success metrics they can't control."

### Scaled Stage ($5M+)
**Sophisticated Compensation Design**

**Multi-Role Compensation:**
- SDRs: Base-heavy, activity-focused
- AEs: Balanced base/commission
- Account Managers: Base-heavy, retention-focused
- Sales Managers: Team performance-based

**Advanced Components:**
- Multi-year deals compensation
- Renewal/expansion bonuses
- Team performance factors
- Margin-based adjustments
- Strategic objective bonuses

**Enterprise Compensation Framework:**
```
Base: $75-150K
Commission: 6-10% (varies by margin)
Accelerators: 125% at 100%, 150% at 120%
Decelerators: 5% below 80% quota
SPIFFs: Quarterly for strategic goals
```

## Compensation Plan Design

### Step 1: Define Your Objectives

**What Behavior Do You Want?**
- New customer acquisition?
- Account expansion?
- Retention improvement?
- Margin protection?
- Market penetration?

**Common Misalignments:**
- Paying for revenue but wanting profit
- Paying for new logos but wanting expansion
- Paying for activity but wanting results
- Paying for quantity but wanting quality

### Step 2: Choose Your Model

**Pure Commission**
- Best for: Proven product, transactional sales
- Typical rate: 10-30% of revenue
- Pros: No fixed costs
- Cons: Hard to recruit, manage

**Base + Commission**
- Best for: Most B2B sales
- Typical split: 50/50 to 60/40
- Pros: Attracts talent, provides stability
- Cons: Higher fixed costs

**Base + Bonus**
- Best for: Complex/enterprise sales
- Typical split: 70/30
- Pros: Focus on quality
- Cons: Less hunger

### Step 3: Set Quotas

**Quota Setting Methods:**

**Historical Method:**
Last year + growth % = This year's quota

**Market Method:**
Market opportunity ÷ reps = Individual quota

**Capacity Method:**
Deals per month × Average deal × 12 = Quota

**Bottom-Up Method:**
Activity metrics × Conversion × Deal size = Quota

**Alan's Quota Rule:**
"If less than 60% of reps hit quota, it's too high. If more than 80% hit it, it's too low."

### Step 4: Design Incentives

**Accelerators (Reward Overperformance):**
- 100-110% of quota: 1.25x rate
- 110-120% of quota: 1.5x rate
- 120%+ of quota: 2x rate

**SPIFFs (Drive Specific Behavior):**
- New product launch
- Competitive displacement
- End-of-quarter push
- Strategic account wins

**Contests (Create Energy):**
- Monthly/quarterly competitions
- Team vs team
- Public leaderboards
- Non-cash prizes often better

### Step 5: Address Edge Cases

**Common Issues to Address:**
- Deals that cancel within 90 days
- Multi-year contract payment
- Team-supported deals
- Inherited accounts
- Price exceptions
- Bad debt

## Alan's Final Compensation Wisdom

"Sales compensation is where theory meets reality. You can have the best product, perfect market fit, and still fail because your comp plan drives the wrong behavior.

Here's what I've learned from paying millions in commissions: People will do exactly what you pay them to do. Not what you hope, not what you ask, but what you pay for. Design accordingly.

Never give equity to salespeople. They're coin-operated by nature—that's why they're good at sales. Equity makes them optimize for exit, not building. Pay them cash, pay them well, but keep the equity.

Keep it simple. If your sales team needs a PhD to calculate their commission, you've already lost. The best plans fit on one page and can be calculated on a napkin.

Don't cap commissions. If someone makes $500K selling, they probably generated $5M+ in revenue. Be thrilled. Your biggest problem should be writing huge commission checks.

Change plans sparingly. Trust is fragile. Change the plan mid-year and your best reps will leave. Annual plans with quarterly SPIFFs for tactical adjustments.

Finally, remember that money motivates but recognition sustains. The best sales cultures combine aggressive compensation with genuine appreciation.

Pay fairly, recognize publicly, and never forget: Your comp plan is your real sales strategy."

**Remember:** People optimize for their paycheck. Design compensation that aligns their success with yours.
