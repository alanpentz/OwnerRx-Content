# PILLAR 2: BUSINESS STRATEGY

## 1. Pillar Header
**Pillar name:** Business Strategy  
**North-star goal:** Business has a clear, defendable position in the market with a roadmap to sustainable competitive advantage  
**Alan's Blunt Truth:** You can't do everything. Pick one thing, measure it, prove it works, then move to the next. Stop believing your own BS about being "the best" - show me the numbers.

## Core Operating Principles (Non-Negotiable)
1. **One Tweak Rule:** Only implement one change at a time. Period.
2. **Data Over Dreams:** The market tells you what works. Your assumptions don't matter.
3. **No Metrics, No Advantage:** If you can't measure it, don't claim it as an advantage.
4. **Trade-offs Are Real:** Every choice sacrifices something. Know what you're giving up.

## Maturity Ladder
- **Stage 0:** Reactive mode - Following market, no clear differentiation
- **Stage 1:** Direction set - Basic strategy documented, positioning defined
- **Stage 2:** Strategic execution - Strategy drives decisions, market position strengthening  
- **Stage 3:** Market leadership - Innovation-driven, setting industry standards

## 2. Standard 7-Step Rhythm
1. **Context load** – Recall industry dynamics, competitive landscape, current position
2. **Clarify objective** – "What market position do you want to own in 90 days?"
3. **Collect baseline data** – Market share, competitor analysis, customer feedback
4. **Personalize questions** – Adapt based on industry maturity and competition
5. **Diagnose/score** – Assess strategic clarity and execution alignment
6. **Recommend plan** – 3-5 strategic initiatives + competitive positioning
7. **Commit & schedule** – Quarterly strategy reviews, monthly initiative tracking

## 4. SUB-PILLAR: Data-Validated Value Proposition

### Sub-pillar name: Data-Validated Value Proposition
**Stage used:** 0-1
**Alan's Reality Check:** Stop guessing what customers want. Look at who pays you the most, the fastest, with the least BS. That's your real value prop.

### 4.1 Purpose
Why this workflow matters: Uses actual customer behavior and profitability data to identify what you're REALLY selling (hint: it's not what you think)

### 4.2 Data Needed
- **From Owner Profile:** Industry, target customer, business model
- **From Live Metrics:** Customer acquisition cost BY SEGMENT, lifetime value BY SEGMENT, service cost BY SEGMENT
- **From Workflow Knowledge:** Customer profitability analysis, segmentation tools

### 4.3 Personalization Questions (Step 4)
1. "Which customers are cheapest to acquire and why?"
2. "Who has the highest gross margin - not revenue, MARGIN?"
3. "Which customers never complain and always pay on time?"
4. "If you could only keep 20% of customers, which ones and why?"

### 4.4 Diagnosis Logic (Step 5)
**The Brutal Truth Method:**
- Calculate ACTUAL profitability per customer type
- Identify your "Golden Geese" (high margin + low drama + repeat buyers)
- Score the gap between what you THINK you sell vs. what data SHOWS you sell
- Reality score: How wrong were you about your value prop? (1-100)

### 4.5 Outputs (Step 6)
- **Deliverable:** Customer Profitability Truth Report (no BS version)
- **Numeric score:** Reality gap score (how wrong you were)
- **Task seeds:**
  - "Calculate gross margin for every customer from last year"
  - "Fire your 3 least profitable customers this quarter"
  - "Double down on your Golden Geese segment"
  - "Stop marketing to everyone and focus on proven profitable segments"

### 4.6 Promotion Trigger

## 5. SUB-PILLAR: Measurable Competitive Advantage

### Sub-pillar name: Measurable Competitive Advantage
**Stage used:** 0-1
**Alan's BS Detector:** "We provide better service" - Really? Prove it. Show me the NPS scores, response times, customer retention rates. No numbers = no advantage.

Why this workflow matters: Transforms vague claims into quantifiable advantages that actually win deals

### 5.2 Data Needed
- **From Owner Profile:** Current differentiation claims (prepare to have them destroyed)

- **From Workflow Knowledge:** Measurement frameworks, competitive intelligence

### 5.3 Personalization Questions (Step 4)
1. "What metrics PROVE you're better than competitors?"
2. "When did you last lose a deal? What was the REAL reason?"
3. "What would happen if you published your performance metrics?"
4. "Can you show customers data that competitors can't?"

### 5.4 Diagnosis Logic (Step 5)
**The Proof or Stop Talking Framework:**
- List all claimed advantages
- Mark which ones have numerical proof
- Score: % of advantages that are measurable
- Reality check: Would a skeptical buyer believe you?

### 5.5 Outputs (Step 6)

## 6. SUB-PILLAR: Business Model One-Tweak Optimization

### Sub-pillar name: Business Model One-Tweak Optimization
**Stage used:** 0-2
**Alan's One-Tweak Rule:** You can't fix everything. Pick ONE thing: payment terms OR pricing OR productization. Do it. Measure it. Then pick the next. Most owners try 5 things, do none well, and wonder why nothing works.

3. "How much cash is stuck in AR right now?"
4. "What custom work do you repeat for every client?"

### 6.4 Diagnosis Logic (Step 5)
**The One-Tweak Decision Tree:**
```
If cash flow sucks → Fix payment terms first
If margins < 50% → Raise prices or cut low-margin work
If everything is custom → Productize one service
If gov contractor → Forget payment terms, productize instead
```

### 6.6 Real Examples That Work

- **Consultants:** Turned custom analysis into productized "Numbers Audit"
- **Agencies:** Moved from hourly to value-based project pricing
- **Service businesses:** Added "rush delivery" at 50% premium
