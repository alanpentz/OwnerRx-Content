## ⚠️ REALITY CHECK: Read This First

**The #1 Sales Delusion:** Thinking you can hire your way out of sales problems.

> "Owners must be the main salesperson until $5M+. Those Oracle salespeople cost $2M/year." - Alan Pentz

This guide covers everything from lead generation to closing. But if you're under $5M in revenue, YOU are the sales team. Accept it, embrace it, excel at it.

## The Only Metric That Matters

Forget pipeline value, qualified leads, opportunity scores, and all other CRM fantasies.

> "Track conversions to sales calls ONLY. Everything else is vanity metrics." - Alan Pentz

**Your Dashboard:**
- How many sales conversations did you have this week?
- How many became customers?
- What was the average deal size?

That's it. If you're not having conversations, you're not selling.

## Sales Reality by Business Type

Your business type determines your sales approach. Stop copying SaaS playbooks if you're a plumber.

|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Local Service** | Trust + urgency sells | Same day - 1 week | 30-40% |

| **B2C Product** | Emotion drives purchase | Minutes - days | 1-3% online, 20-40% in-store |
| **B2B SaaS** | Value justification | 3-6 months | 15-25% |
| **Manufacturing** | RFP process dominates | 1-6 months | 10-20% |
| **Consulting** | Expertise demonstration | 6-36 weeks | 60% from referrals, 10% cold |

## The Sales Process That Actually Works

### Phase 1: Lead Generation ($0-1M Revenue)
**The Truth:** You need ONE reliable source of leads, not ten mediocre ones.

#### Proven Lead Sources (Pick ONE):
1. **Referrals** (58% conversion rate)
   - Ask every customer: "Who else needs this?"
   - Create referral incentive program
   - Follow up on EVERY referral within 24 hours

2. **Your Existing Network**
   - Mine your email and calendar with AI
   - > "Connect Claude to your email and calendar TODAY. Mine the gold already there." - Alan

3. **One Marketing Channel** (see Marketing guide)
   - Master it before adding another
   - Track: Channel → Conversation → Sale

#### AI Enhancement:
- **Clay.com** ($149/month): Enrich and find leads from your network
- **Apollo.io** ($49/month): Find contact info and automate outreach
- **ChatGPT**: Analyze your email/calendar exports for opportunities

### Phase 2: Sales Conversations ($1-5M Revenue)

#### The Simple Framework:
> "Talk to customers, test messaging. Something will click." - Alan Pentz

**The 5-Touch Reality:**
Research shows 80% of sales require 5+ follow-ups. Most salespeople quit after 2.

**Touch Cadence That Works:**
1. **Day 0:** Initial contact/response
2. **Day 1:** Follow-up with value add
3. **Day 3:** Check-in with new information
4. **Day 7:** Share relevant case study
5. **Day 14:** Final "should I close your file?" email

#### Conversation Structure:
1. **Understand** (40% of time)
   - What's broken?
   - What have they tried?
   - What's the cost of not fixing it?

2. **Educate** (30% of time)
   - Share how you've solved similar problems
   - Provide immediate value (even if they don't buy)

3. **Propose** (20% of time)
   - One-page proposal max
   - Three options (good, better, best)
   - Clear next steps

4. **Close** (10% of time)
   - "Does this solve your problem?"
   - "What questions do you have?"
   - "When would you like to start?"

#### AI Tools for Conversations:
- **Fireflies.ai** ($10/month): Transcribe and analyze all calls
- **Gong.io** (Enterprise): Conversation intelligence
- **ChatGPT**: Prep for calls, analyze transcripts

---

### Phase 3: Closing & Pricing ($5M+ Revenue)

#### The Pricing Mistake Everyone Makes:
> "They discount before anyone asks. Stop negotiating against yourself." - Alan Pentz

**Pricing Psychology That Works:**
1. **Anchor High:** Start with premium option
2. **Offer Three Options:** Let them choose their price point
3. **Never Discount First:** Wait for them to ask
4. **Bundle Value:** Add services, not discounts

#### Closing Techniques That Convert:

**The Assumptive Close:**
"Based on what you've told me, we should start with [solution]. I can begin next week or the week after. Which works better?"

**The Urgency Close (When Real):**
"I have two spots opening up this month. If we start now, you'll see results before [relevant deadline]."

**The Risk Reversal:**
"Try it for 30 days. If you don't see value, we'll refund everything and part as friends."

#### Technology Stack:
- **PandaDoc** ($19/month): Proposals with e-signatures
- **Stripe/Square**: Instant payment collection
- **HubSpot Sales** (Free tier): Basic CRM and pipeline

## Common Sales Delusions to Avoid

### 🚩 "We need a better CRM"
Your CRM isn't the problem. Your lack of conversations is.

### 🚩 "Let's hire a salesperson"
Not until you've proven the sales process yourself.

### 🚩 "We need more leads"
You need better conversations with the leads you have.

### 🚩 "Our price is too high"
> "Stop negotiating against yourself." Focus on value, not price.

### 🚩 "Email marketing doesn't work"
You're probably sending features, not solving problems.

## Remember This

> "Owners sell until $5M+. Those Oracle salespeople cost $2M/year." - Alan Pentz

You are your best salesperson. Not because you're naturally gifted at sales, but because you understand the problem you solve better than anyone.

Every sales methodology, every CRM, every automation tool is just supporting what matters: **conversations with people who have problems you can solve.**

Track conversations. Have more of them. The rest is details.
