## 12. ALAN'S INSIGHTS AND STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Product Page Optimization Before Advertising

"Never pour advertising dollars into a leaky bucket. Your product page must convert before you advertise." - Alan's First Law of Amazon Advertising

**Pre-Advertising Checklist:**
- [ ] Conversion rate minimum 10% (category dependent)

**Profitability Framework:**
1. **Calculate True Cost**: Include all Amazon fees, not just advertising
2. **Measure Organic Lift**: 15-30% of advertised sales typically lift organic sales

**Total Impact Measurement:**

- **Cross-Platform Impact**: Amazon advertising improving other channel performance
- **Customer Data**: Email capture and retargeting opportunities

"Give Amazon advertising 90 days before making strategic decisions. The platform needs time to optimize, and you need data to make intelligent choices."

**90-Day Milestones:**
- **Days 1-30**: Data gathering and initial optimization
- **Days 31-60**: Strategy refinement and scaling decisions
- **Days 61-90**: Performance analysis and strategic planning
- **Day 91+**: Major strategic decisions and portfolio changes
