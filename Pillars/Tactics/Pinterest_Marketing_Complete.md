## Strategic Foundation

### Alan's Core Insights

**Visual Quality Determines Success**
Pinterest is inherently visual, making design quality the primary factor in pin performance:
- High-quality, bright images outperform dark or low-resolution content
- Vertical pins (2:3 aspect ratio) receive 60% more engagement
- Text overlay increases saves by 30%
- Brand consistency builds recognition and trust

**Consistency Beats Viral Moments**
While viral content can provide temporary boosts, sustainable Pinterest growth comes from:
