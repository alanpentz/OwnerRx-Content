## ALAN'S REALITY CHECK

> "Google Ads is just an auction where you pay for attention. If your math doesn't work at current prices, you either need better conversion, higher prices, or a different channel. Stop hoping it'll magically get cheaper - it won't."

**The Brutal Truth**:
- Most businesses lose money first 30 days (normal)
- 50% of budget will be "wasted" on learning
- You're competing against companies with million-dollar budgets
- The platform wants you to spend more, not efficiently
- Success requires constant optimization, not set-and-forget

**But Also**:
- It's the fastest way to test market demand
- You can be profitable in 60-90 days with discipline
- Small local businesses can compete with giants
- One good converting keyword can build a business
- It's still the highest-intent traffic you can buy

*Remember: Track conversions to sales calls, not clicks. Every other metric is vanity.*
