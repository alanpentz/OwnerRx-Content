# Team Knowledge Base

## Business Context Variables
*These factors determine HOW you implement tactics, not WHETHER you should use them*

### Required Information to Collect:
- **Revenue**: Current annual revenue
- **Team Size**: Number of employees/contractors
- **Business Type**: Local service / Professional services / E-commerce / SaaS / Manufacturing / Other
- **Industry**: Specific vertical and regulations
- **Geography**: Local / Regional / National / International
- **Customer Type**: B2B / B2C / B2B2C
- **Resources**: 
  - Budget available for team development (monthly)
  - Owner time available for team management (hours/week)
  - Team expertise level (None/Basic/Intermediate/Advanced)

---

## Core Principles

### Fundamental Truths
*These apply to EVERY business regardless of size or type*
- Your team is your business - they determine 21-58% of your profit margin
- Every person on your team either accelerates or drains company growth
- The wrong person in a key role doesn't just fail to move you forward - they actively hold you back
- When you double revenue, expect 50% of leadership roles to turn over - growth outpaces people
- You already know who your underperformers are - you're just avoiding the conversation

### The One Metric That Matters
- **Primary KPI**: Team Performance Index (combination of productivity, engagement, and retention)
- **How to measure**: (Productivity Score × Engagement Score × (100 - Turnover %)) / 100
- **Frequency**: Weekly tracking, monthly deep analysis
- **Target range**: Solo: 60-70 | Resourced: 70-80 | Scaled: 80-90

### Supporting Metrics
#### Leading Indicators
- Weekly 1-on-1 completion rate (predicts engagement issues)
- Time-to-productivity for new hires (predicts hiring process effectiveness)
- Employee referral rate (predicts culture health)

#### Lagging Indicators  
- Revenue per employee (confirms team effectiveness)
- Voluntary turnover rate (validates culture and management)
- Promotion rate from within (confirms development programs)

## Diagnostic Trees

### Problem: Team Performance Issues

#### What You're Experiencing:
- "I'm doing their work for them"
- "Good people keep leaving"
- "I can't find qualified candidates"
- "My team needs constant supervision"
- "Revenue is stuck despite adding people"

#### Diagnostic Questions:
1. Are you hiring for trajectory or current capability?
2. Do you have clear outputs and outcomes defined for each role?
3. Can you identify who your growth blockers are right now?
4. Are you micromanaging or truly delegating?

#### Root Cause Analysis:

**If** answers indicate hiring problems:
- **Root cause**: Wrong hiring sequence - hiring domestically first instead of AI-first
- **Solution path**: Implement the 85% Rule decision tree
- **Implementation varies by**:
  - 🚀 **Solo/Bootstrap** ($0 budget): Use AI tools for 85% of tasks, hire only what's left
  - 💰 **Resourced** ($100-1000/mo): Global talent for remote work, AI for automation
  - 🏢 **Scaled** ($1000+/mo): Build hybrid teams with AI, global, and domestic talent

**If** answers indicate performance issues:
- **Root cause**: Lack of clear accountability and outcomes definition
- **Solution path**: Implement outputs/outcomes framework with weekly reviews
- **Implementation varies by**:
  - 🚀 **Solo/Bootstrap**: Manual weekly 1-on-1s with simple tracking
  - 💰 **Resourced**: Recorded meetings with AI analysis and extraction
  - 🏢 **Scaled**: Automated performance dashboards with predictive analytics

**If** answers indicate growth blocking:
- **Root cause**: Loyalty trap - keeping people past their competence ceiling
- **Solution path**: 4-Factor Team Audit and systematic role transitions
- **Implementation varies by**:
  - 🚀 **Solo/Bootstrap**: Direct conversations and role adjustments
  - 💰 **Resourced**: Professional coaching and transition support
  - 🏢 **Scaled**: Structured succession planning and leadership development

#### Red Flags:
- ⚠️ If you haven't defined outputs/outcomes for roles, this is actually a STRATEGY problem
- 🚨 If you're avoiding firing decisions for >90 days, stop everything and make the call
