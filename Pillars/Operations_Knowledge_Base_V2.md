# Operations Knowledge Base

## Business Context Variables
*These factors determine HOW you implement tactics, not WHETHER you should use them*

### Required Information to Collect:
- **Revenue**: Current annual revenue
- **Team Size**: Number of employees/contractors
- **Business Type**: Local service / Professional services / E-commerce / SaaS / Manufacturing / Other
- **Industry**: Specific vertical and regulations
- **Geography**: Local / Regional / National / International
- **Customer Type**: B2B / B2C / B2B2C
- **Resources**: 
  - Budget available for operations (monthly)
  - Owner time available (hours/week)
  - Team expertise level (None/Basic/Intermediate/Advanced)

---

## Core Principles

### Fundamental Truths
*These apply to EVERY business regardless of size or type*
- Operations should run without you - if you're the bottleneck, you don't have operations, you have expensive manual labor
- Documentation that isn't auditable doesn't get followed - static docs die in folders
- The visible bottleneck is rarely the real bottleneck - subordinate everything to the real constraint first
- Quality problems are system problems, not people problems - fix the process, not blame the person
- Quality problems are usually handoff problems - fix the transitions between people/departments

### Scaling Break Points
**Companies break at predictable employee counts:**
- 10 employees: Communication breaks (everyone can't talk to everyone)
- 25 employees: Management layer required (owner can't manage directly)
- 50 employees: Systems mandatory (tribal knowledge fails)
- 150 employees: Bureaucracy emerges (Dunbar's number exceeded)

**Each break requires different solutions:**
- Different systems and structures needed
- What worked before actively hurts now
- 70-75% utilization optimal (>85% causes systemic breaks)
- Plan transitions before you hit the number

> **Universal Business Insight #56: The Implementation Gap Crisis**
> 
> **Problem:** SMBs know exactly what to do but consistently fail to execute
> 
> Bridge the knowing-doing gap with execution support. Knowledge is now free (AI, YouTube, courses), but execution is the new scarcity. "I'll do it for you" beats "Here's how to do it." New business models: results-based payment (10-15% of value created), "do it with you" partnerships, fractional execution roles.
> 
> **Universal Truth:** "In the age of free knowledge (AI), execution is the new scarcity - doing beats knowing"

### The One Metric That Matters
- **Primary KPI**: Operational Independence Score - percentage of operations that run without owner intervention
- **How to measure**: Count decisions/tasks requiring owner input divided by total operational tasks per week
- **Frequency**: Weekly assessment
- **Target range**: Varies by business maturity (see variations below)

### Supporting Metrics
#### Leading Indicators
- Process adherence rate (percentage of checklists completed properly)
- Time to complete standard operations (cycle time trending)

#### Lagging Indicators  
- Customer complaint frequency (quality consistency)
- Owner time spent "in the weeds" (operational independence)

## Diagnostic Trees

### Problem: Owner is stuck doing everything operational

> **Universal Business Insight #122: Time Poverty Recognition**
> 
> **Problem:** Unrealistic expectations about time
> 
> Plan for extreme constraints until employee 4-5. The reality check: 60+ hour weeks minimum, no real vacations, everything takes longer, constant interruptions, decision fatigue. Survival strategies: automate everything possible, outsource before hiring, say no to most opportunities, focus on highest impact, protect health/family time. Expect Years 1-2: Survival, Years 2-3: Stabilization, Years 3-5: Growth, Years 5+: Systems.
> 
> **Universal Truth:** "Time poverty is the tax on business ownership"

#### What You're Experiencing:
- "I'm the only one who can handle problems"
- "My team asks me for every decision"
- "Quality drops when I'm not watching"

#### Diagnostic Questions:
1. What percentage of your time is spent fixing things vs building things?
2. How many times per day does someone interrupt you for operational questions?
3. If you disappeared for a week, what would break first?

#### Root Cause Analysis:

**If** answers indicate owner-dependency pattern:
- **Root cause**: No documented processes or accountability systems
- **Solution path**: Process documentation with audit systems
- **Implementation varies by**:
  - üöÄ **Solo/Bootstrap** ($0 budget): Record yourself doing tasks, use AI to create checklists, enforce weekly reviews
  - üí∞ **Resourced** ($100-1000/mo): Project management software with accountability, dedicated process auditor
  - üè¢ **Scaled** ($1000+/mo): Operations manager owns process compliance, automated tracking systems

**If** answers indicate quality inconsistency:
- **Root cause**: Missing quality control systems
- **Solution path**: Implement inspection and feedback loops
- **Implementation varies by**:
  - üöÄ **Solo/Bootstrap**: Customer feedback collection, simple quality checklists
  - üí∞ **Resourced**: Quality control software, customer satisfaction surveys
  - üè¢ **Scaled**: Quality assurance team, statistical quality control

#### Red Flags:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If revenue is declining while you fix operations, this is actually a SALES/MARKETING problem
- üö® If cash flow is negative, stop everything and fix FINANCE first

## Quick Reference

### Daily Check (30 seconds):
*Same for everyone, different thresholds*
- [ ] **Process Adherence**: Target varies (Solo: 80% | Resourced: 90% | Scaled: 95%)
- [ ] **Bottleneck Status**: Check for work piling up anywhere in system

### Weekly Review:
*Depth varies by available time*
- **5-minute version**: Review key operational metrics dashboard
- **30-minute version**: Analyze trends and identify needed adjustments
- **Team version**: Collaborative review of operational performance and improvement opportunities

### Crisis Protocols:

#### üö® Operational Failure
**Everyone do immediately**:
1. Assess customer impact and communicate proactively
2. Implement backup procedures or workarounds

**Then based on resources**:
- **Solo**: Focus on customer retention while fixing root cause
- **Resourced**: Delegate customer communication while leading problem resolution
- **Scaled**: Activate incident response team with clear role assignments

## Integration Points

### Dependencies:
- **Requires from Finance**: Budget allocation for operational improvements and ROI measurement
- **Requires from Team**: Skilled team members to execute operational processes
- **Requires from Sales/Marketing**: Demand forecasts to plan operational capacity

### Provides to Strategy:
- **Provides to Strategy**: Operational capacity data for growth planning
- **Provides to Finance**: Operational cost data and efficiency metrics
- **Provides to Team**: Clear processes and performance standards

### Handoff Triggers:
- If operational capacity becomes growth constraint, engage Strategy pillar for capacity expansion planning
- If operational costs exceed budget, engage Finance pillar for cost optimization
- If team performance gaps limit operations, engage Team pillar for skills development

## Key Insights

### Alan's Wisdom:
> "They need to get a software tool in place or some system where they can get people to use checklists. Then you can audit the checklists."

> "First they have no idea how to find the bottleneck and when they find it they immediately try to replicate the bottleneck resource before doing the investigation to take the burden off the bottleneck."

> "It should be your key thinking partner as an owner. Almost all owners who aren't doing physical tasks should be in it [AI] every day."

### Reality Checks:
- üí° **INSIGHT**: Documentation fails because it's static. Checklists in software get used because they can be audited
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: The visible bottleneck is rarely the real bottleneck - look for where work actually stops
- üéØ **QUICK WIN**: Use AI daily for business decisions - it's your thinking partner, not just a tool
- üîÑ **ITERATE**: Record yourself doing tasks, use AI to create checklists, then audit compliance weekly

## Implementation Advisor

### Based on your variables, prioritize:

**If** Solo operator with < $100/month:
1. Process Documentation using video + AI method
2. Personal bottleneck analysis and task reorganization
3. Basic quality checklists for key deliverables
4. Skip complex systems until you have team to utilize them

**If** Small team with $100-1000/month:
1. Team-based process documentation with accountability
2. Systematic bottleneck identification across team workflows
3. Quality control systems with customer feedback loops
4. Begin automation of highest-impact repetitive tasks

**If** Growing team with > $1000/month:
1. Enterprise-level operational systems with continuous improvement
2. Comprehensive capacity planning and resource optimization
3. Advanced quality management with predictive analytics
4. Full automation and AI integration across operational processes

## Success Patterns

### What "Good" Looks Like:
*Adjusted for your situation*

| Metric | Solo Target | Resourced Target | Scaled Target |
|--------|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| Operational Independence | 60% | 80% | 95% |
| Process Adherence Rate | 80% | 90% | 95% |
| Quality Consistency | 90% satisfaction | 95% satisfaction | 98% satisfaction |
| Timeline to Results | 3-6 months | 2-4 months | 1-3 months |

### When to Level Up:
- **Solo ‚Üí Resourced**: When owner time becomes the primary bottleneck to growth
- **Resourced ‚Üí Scaled**: When team coordination becomes more complex than individual contributions
