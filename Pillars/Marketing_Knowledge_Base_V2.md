# Marketing Knowledge Base V2
## Drive Demand Without Wasting Money on Vanity Metrics

### Executive Summary: Marketing That Actually Drives Revenue

Most businesses treat marketing as an expense. They chase viral moments, obsess over impressions, and celebrate vanity metrics while their bank account stays empty. Real marketing creates predictable demand for sales to close.

**Alan's Core Philosophy:** "Marketing should pay for itself within 90 days or it's a hobby. Spend 5-10% of revenue, focus on one channel until it works, and use AI for everything. Brand doesn't matter until $5M—until then, you ARE the brand."

This knowledge base shows you how to build marketing that generates measurable revenue, not just pretty reports.

## Business Context Variables
*These factors determine HOW you implement marketing tactics, not WHETHER you should use them*

### Required Information to Collect:
- **Revenue**: Current annual revenue and growth targets
- **Budget**: Marketing spend available (should be 5-10% of revenue)
- **Business Model**: B2B / B2C / B2B2C / Marketplace
- **Average Customer Value**: LTV and initial purchase size
- **Sales Cycle**: Immediate / Short (days) / Long (months)
- **Market Position**: Unknown / Challenger / Leader
- **Resources**: 
  - Budget available for marketing (monthly)
  - Time available (hours/week)
  - Team capabilities (none/basic/advanced)

## Core Principles

### The Marketing Reality Check
*Alan's non-negotiable truths about marketing*

1. **5-10% of Revenue Budget** - "Less and you're invisible, more and you're gambling"
2. **One Channel Focus** - "Master one channel before adding another"
3. **AI is Mandatory** - "If you're not using AI for marketing, you're already obsolete"
4. **Brand Follows Revenue** - "Below $5M, you ARE the brand. Focus on selling."
5. **Attribution is Fuzzy** - "Perfect attribution is impossible. Accept it and move on."

### The One Metric That Matters
- **Primary KPI**: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Payback Period
- **Formula**: CAC ÷ (Monthly Revenue per Customer)
- **Target**: <6 months for B2C, <12 months for B2B
- **Why**: Cash flow is king—how fast you get money back determines survival

### Supporting Metrics by Function

#### Demand Generation
- Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs)
- Cost per MQL by channel
- MQL to SQL conversion rate

#### Brand Building
- Direct traffic growth
- Branded search volume
- Share of voice (only after $5M)

#### Revenue Attribution
- Marketing sourced pipeline
- Marketing influenced revenue
- Channel ROI (accept it's imperfect)

## The Bottom Line

Marketing isn't mysterious. It's finding where your customers are, figuring out what they respond to, and doing more of that while measuring everything.

Don't chase awards, viral moments, or vanity metrics. Chase customers, revenue, and profitable growth. Everything else is expensive entertainment.

Start with one channel. Use AI for everything. Spend 5-10% of revenue. And remember: below $5M, you don't need a brand—you need customers.

*Remember: Marketing exists to make sales easier. If it's not driving revenue, it's not marketing—it's an expense.*
