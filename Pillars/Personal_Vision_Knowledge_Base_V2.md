- **Industry**: Specific vertical and regulations
- **Geography**: Local / Regional / National / International

## Core Principles

### Fundamental Truths
*These apply to EVERY business regardless of size or type*
- Business should serve your life, not the other way around
- Your energy is more important than your time - protect it ruthlessly
- 80% of businesses never sell - plan to keep and optimize, not exit
- You'll double your wealth target as you approach it - everyone does
- Being the hub in a hub-and-spoke system works until $2M, then it kills growth
- Most owners max out spending at $1M/year ($25M invested at 4% withdrawal)
- Beyond $25M, you're buying your future son-in-law a nicer Ferrari

### The One Metric That Matters
- **Primary KPI**: Energy Optimization Score (energy-giving hours / total working hours)
- **How to measure**: Track hourly energy levels (1-10) for one week, categorize activities
- **Frequency**: Weekly review, monthly deep analysis
- **Target range**: 
  - Solo/Bootstrap: >40% (challenging but achievable)
  - Resourced: >60% (with help and delegation)
  - Scaled: >80% (with full team support)

### Supporting Metrics
#### Leading Indicators
- Hours spent in "flow state" per week
- Number of energy-draining tasks delegated
- Weekly alignment score (daily decisions match stated vision)
- Time spent on superpower activities vs. weakness areas

#### Lagging Indicators  
- Overall life satisfaction score (1-10)
- Work-life integration quality
- Progress toward personal wealth targets
- Physical and mental health indicators

## Diagnostic Trees

### Problem: Owner Feels Overwhelmed and Burning Out

#### What You're Experiencing:
- "I'm working 60+ hour weeks but never catching up"
- "My team depends on me for every decision"
- "I can't take vacation without everything falling apart"
- "I started this business for freedom but feel more trapped than ever"

#### Diagnostic Questions:
1. How many hours per week are you working on tasks only you can do?
2. What percentage of your decisions could someone else make with clear guidelines?
3. When did you last have a full weekend without business thoughts or calls?

#### Root Cause Analysis:

**If** answers indicate Hub-and-Spoke Trap (you make all decisions):
- **Root cause**: Business structure depends entirely on owner as single decision point
- **Solution path**: Create multiple "hubs" through delegation and systems
- **Implementation varies by**:
  - üöÄ **Solo/Bootstrap** ($0-100 budget): Start with virtual assistant for admin tasks, create decision frameworks in Google Docs
  - üí∞ **Resourced** ($500-2000/mo): Hire experienced operations manager, implement project management systems
  - üè¢ **Scaled** ($2000+/mo): Build leadership team with clear ownership areas, executive dashboard systems

**If** answers indicate Energy Misalignment (doing wrong work):
- **Root cause**: Spending high-energy time on low-value or draining activities
- **Solution path**: Map energy patterns and realign calendar to superpower work
- **Implementation varies by**:
  - üöÄ **Solo/Bootstrap**: Use free time-tracking apps, manually audit calendar weekly
  - üí∞ **Resourced**: Hire assistant to handle draining tasks, use paid productivity tools
  - üè¢ **Scaled**: Full calendar management, executive assistant, optimized daily routine

#### Red Flags:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If working >70 hours/week consistently, this is actually a Team & Leadership problem
- üö® If health issues emerging, stop everything and address personal sustainability first

---

### Problem: Lack of Clear Life Direction and Purpose

#### What You're Experiencing:
- "I don't know why I'm building this business anymore"
- "Success doesn't feel as satisfying as I expected"
- "I keep moving the goalposts on what 'enough' looks like"
- "My business is successful but my life feels out of balance"

#### Diagnostic Questions:
1. Can you clearly articulate your personal "why" in one sentence?
2. How do your daily business decisions connect to your long-term life goals?
3. What would you do if you sold your business tomorrow?

#### Root Cause Analysis:

**If** answers indicate Vision Drift (started with purpose, lost connection):
- **Root cause**: Success created complexity that obscured original motivation
- **Solution path**: Reconnect with foundational purpose and realign business to serve it
- **Implementation varies by**:
  - üöÄ **Solo/Bootstrap**: Weekly vision journaling, quarterly solo retreats for reflection
  - üí∞ **Resourced**: Work with executive coach, join mastermind group for accountability
  - üè¢ **Scaled**: Formal vision alignment process with leadership team, annual strategic planning

**If** answers indicate External Validation Trap (chasing others' definition of success):
- **Root cause**: Building business for ego, investor pressure, or social status rather than personal fulfillment
- **Solution path**: Define personal success metrics independent of external approval
- **Implementation varies by**:
  - üöÄ **Solo/Bootstrap**: Values clarification exercises, peer advisory groups with like-minded owners
  - üí∞ **Resourced**: Executive coaching focused on authentic leadership, leadership assessments
  - üè¢ **Scaled**: Comprehensive leadership development, cultural alignment initiatives

#### Red Flags:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If considering major life changes (divorce, career change), this is also a Personal Risk Management issue
- üö® If substance use or health issues emerging, address immediately with professional help

## Key Insights

### Alan's Wisdom:
> "Business should serve your life, not the other way around. Your energy is more important than your time. 80% of businesses never sell - plan to keep it and optimize it."

> "You'll double your number as you approach it - everyone does. Most people max out spending at $1M a year. Beyond $25M, you're buying your future son-in-law a nicer Ferrari."

> "The key is the link to your energy as an owner. In the end your energy is your purpose. If you can align your company so that you are working in what gives you energy, that's the goal. The money will come."

### Reality Checks:
- üí° **INSIGHT**: Most owners operate in hub-and-spoke until $2M+ revenue, then it becomes the growth ceiling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Identity over-tied to business success creates vulnerability during business challenges
- üéØ **QUICK WIN**: Hire admin or operations person to immediately reclaim 10-20 hours/week
- üîÑ **ITERATE**: Energy patterns and life priorities change - regular reassessment prevents drift
