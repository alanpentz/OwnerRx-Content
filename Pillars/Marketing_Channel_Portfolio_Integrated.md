## ⚠️ WARNING: Read This First

**The #1 Marketing Mistake:** Trying to do everything at once.

> "The first mistake is spreading yourself too thin. You should nail one channel at a time. It requires focus to master just one channel." - Alan Pentz

This guide covers 9+ marketing channels. **DO NOT try to implement them all.** Use the Business Type Matching Matrix below to find your ONE channel, master it, then expand.

## The Only Metric That Matters

Forget impressions, clicks, engagement rates, and all other vanity metrics.

> "You should track conversions to a sales call or sales process. Doesn't matter if that's Google Ads or conference attendance." - Alan Pentz

**Your Dashboard:** 
- How many sales conversations did this channel create this week?
- What did each conversation cost?
- How many converted to customers?

That's it. Everything else is noise.

## Business Type Channel Matching Matrix

Stop looking for "best practices." Your business type determines your channel.

| Your Business | Start Here | Why It Works | Success Metric |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Local Service** (plumber, dentist, lawyer) | Google Ads + Reviews | "If it's a local business it's Google Ads and in particular Google reviews" | Phone calls booked |
| **Professional Services** (consulting, agency) | LinkedIn + Lunches | "If it's professional services LinkedIn rocks" | Discovery calls scheduled |
| **B2C Product** (<$100 purchase) | Meta + TikTok | "If it's B2C it's Meta and TikTok" | Orders placed |
| **B2B SaaS** (software, tools) | Content/SEO + Email | Long-term trust building | Free trials started |
| **Manufacturing** | Trade Shows + Email | "Many manufacturing companies still do great at industry trade shows" | RFQs received |
| **Local Professional Services** | Networking + Referrals | "Going to lunch with people is great marketing" | Referrals received |

- Ask about common mistakes and shortcuts

### Week 4: Copy the Winners
> "Start analyzing what the best people using that tactic are doing. There's almost always a best practice you can find."

## Red Flags & Reality Checks

### 🚩 Agency Warning
> "Don't go with multi-service agencies. They are average at everything. Get a specialist in the narrow channel you plan to use."

### 🚩 Contract Protection
> "Keep contract terms short so you can get out of the contract if it's not working."

### 🚩 The Spreading Thin Trap
> "Marketing is where the answers for businesses are the most diverse."

This diversity is a trap. Pick one, master it, then expand.

### 🚩 The AI Nurturing Paradox
> "In the AI content world it takes more nurturing to get leads to convert."

AI creates content faster but requires MORE human touch to close deals.

The best marketing channel is the one you actually execute consistently.
