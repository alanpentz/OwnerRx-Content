# Pillar Restructuring Template - New Goal-Driven Architecture

## HOW ALL PILLARS (Except Personal Vision) SHOULD BE STRUCTURED

### OVERVIEW OF NEW APPROACH

Instead of forcing users through all workflows sequentially, we now:
1. Gather essential context (Foundation Layer)
2. Identify their specific challenge/goal
3. Orchestrator recommends the RIGHT workflow for RIGHT NOW
4. User completes only what they need
5. Can return for other workflows when relevant

---

## STANDARD PILLAR STRUCTURE

### Part 1: FOUNDATION LAYER (Required)
```
# [Pillar Name] - Intelligent Workflow System

## FOUNDATION LAYER: Essential Context (Complete First)

### Basic Information
- Business context questions (5-10 questions)
- Current state assessment (3-5 ratings)
- Pain points checklist
- Primary challenge identification
- 90-day outcome needed
```

### Part 2: ORCHESTRATOR LOGIC
```
## ORCHESTRATOR DECISION LOGIC

If Challenge = "[specific problem]" 
â†’ Recommended Workflow: [Workflow name]
â†’ Expected Outcome: [Specific result]
â†’ Time Required: [X hours]
â†’ ROI: [Expected return]
```

### Part 3: WORKFLOW MENU
```
## AVAILABLE WORKFLOWS (Triggered by Need)

### WORKFLOW MENU

**Category 1: [Type of Problems]**
- ðŸŽ¯ Workflow A - When [trigger condition]
- ðŸŽ¯ Workflow B - When [trigger condition]

**Category 2: [Type of Problems]**
- ðŸŽ¯ Workflow C - When [trigger condition]
- ðŸŽ¯ Workflow D - When [trigger condition]
```

### Part 4: INDIVIDUAL WORKFLOWS
```
## WORKFLOW X: [Name]
**Trigger:** User says "[problem statement]" OR Orchestrator detects [condition]
**Outcome:** [Specific deliverable]
**Time:** [X hours]

[Workflow content...]
```

## KEY PRINCIPLES OF NEW STRUCTURE

### 1. Problem-First, Not Process-First
- Start with user's actual pain
- Deliver specific solution
- Skip irrelevant workflows

### 2. Time-Efficient
- Each workflow = 1-3 hours
- Clear outcome defined
- ROI calculated upfront

### 3. Dynamic Routing
- Orchestrator reads context
- Recommends based on impact
- User can override

### 4. Return When Needed
- Not everything at once
- Come back for new challenges
- Workflows stay available

### 5. Measurable Outcomes
- Each workflow has success metrics
- Track implementation
- Measure ROI

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### For App Development:

1. **Foundation Layer = Onboarding**
   - One-time setup per pillar
   - Updates quarterly
   - Feeds all workflows

2. **Orchestrator = Smart Router**
   - Reads foundation data
   - Analyzes patterns
   - Suggests next best action

3. **Workflows = Modular Tools**
   - Self-contained
   - Can run independently
   - Share foundation data

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Which workflows completed
   - Outcomes achieved
   - ROI realized

### For Users:

1. **Faster Time to Value**
   - Get solution in 1-3 hours
   - Not 6 workflows to wade through

2. **Higher Relevance**
   - Only do what matters now
   - Skip what doesn't apply

3. **Better ROI**
   - Focus on highest impact
   - Orchestrator prioritizes

4. **Flexibility**
   - Choose your own path
   - Override recommendations
   - Return when ready

## MIGRATION CHECKLIST

For each pillar (except Personal Vision):

- [ ] Extract Foundation Layer questions
- [ ] Create pain point checklist
- [ ] Define Orchestrator logic rules
- [ ] Reorganize workflows as triggered modules
- [ ] Add trigger conditions to each workflow
- [ ] Define expected outcomes and ROI
- [ ] Create workflow menu with icons
- [ ] Test orchestrator recommendations

This new structure makes the system:
- **Faster** - Get to solutions quickly
- **Smarter** - Right solution for right problem
- **Flexible** - User-driven or orchestrator-guided
- **Valuable** - Focus on ROI, not completion
