## Agent Communication Protocols

### Message Priority Levels
```python
priority_matrix = {
    "CRITICAL": "Cash crisis, major customer loss, system down",
    "HIGH": "Bottleneck identified, opportunity expiring soon",
    "MEDIUM": "Regular optimization, scheduled reviews",
    "LOW": "Nice-to-have improvements, future planning"
}
```

### Agent Interaction Rules
1. **User Advocate Override**
   - Can veto any recommendation
   - Must approve all user-facing outputs
   - Sets pacing for all changes

2. **Research Agent Service**
   - Serves all requests within 24 hours
   - Prioritizes by business impact
   - Caches common queries

3. **Orchestrator Routing**
   - Routes based on pillar maturity
   - Balances agent workload
   - Prevents conflicting recommendations

## Workflow Execution Example

### Sample User Journey: "Help me get more profitable"

1. **Orchestrator** receives request
2. **Orchestrator** checks pillar maturity
3. Routes to **Finance Agent** (primary) and **Operations Agent** (secondary)
4. **Finance Agent** initiates 7-step rhythm:
   - Loads owner profile (service business, 15 employees, 8% margin)
   - Clarifies objective ("15% margin in 90 days")
   - Collects baseline (full P&L analysis)
   - Personalizes questions (pricing, costs, efficiency)
   - Diagnoses issues (underpricing, high labor costs)
   - Recommends plan (raise prices 10%, reduce overtime)
   - Commits to weekly margin tracking
5. **User Advocate** reviews and simplifies
6. **Deep Research** provides pricing study
7. **Quality Control** ensures consistency
8. Owner receives 3-step action plan

### Agent Learning Protocol
```python
learning_cycle = {
    "collect": "Gather outcome data from implementations",
    "analyze": "Identify successful patterns",
    "update": "Refine recommendation algorithms",
    "test": "Validate with subset of users",
    "deploy": "Roll out improvements system-wide"
}
```

## Risk Management

### Common Failure Points
1. **Overwhelm** → User Advocate intervention
2. **Conflicting advice** → Orchestrator resolution
3. **Resource constraints** → Phased implementation
4. **Low engagement** → Simplify and quick wins
5. **Poor data** → Research Agent validation

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with highest-impact, lowest-effort actions
- Limit active recommendations to 5 maximum
- Weekly check-ins to adjust pacing
- Celebrate small wins to build momentum
- Always provide "bare minimum" option
