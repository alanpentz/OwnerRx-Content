# Business Maturity Assessment Tool
*Diagnose Your Business Health Across All Critical Dimensions*

## Executive Summary

You can't improve what you don't measure, and you can't measure what you don't define. This comprehensive assessment tool evaluates your business across six critical pillars—Sales, Marketing, Operations, Finance, Team, and Business Strategy—providing a clear diagnosis of where you are, where you need to be, and exactly how to get there.

Unlike generic business assessments that give you a score and leave you guessing, this tool provides specific, actionable insights for each maturity level. You'll know exactly which playbooks to implement, in what order, to move your business from wherever it is today to where you want it to be.

3. **Identify gaps** - Compare current vs. desired state
