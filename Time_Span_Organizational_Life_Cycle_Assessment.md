# Time Span & Organizational Life Cycle Assessment
*Advanced Frameworks for Management Capability and Organizational Development*

## Executive Summary

This assessment combines two powerful frameworks that explain why businesses get stuck and how to break through:

1. **Time Span of Discretion Framework** - Based on organizational research, this reveals whether your managers have the cognitive capability to handle their roles
2. **Organizational Life Cycle Model** - Maps where your organization is in its development journey and what management capabilities you need

**The Bottom Line:** Most promotion failures and organizational plateaus happen because we promote people beyond their time span capability or don't adjust management needs as the organization evolves.

## PART 1: TIME SPAN OF DISCRETION ASSESSMENT
*Based on Time Span Research*

### Understanding Time Span Levels (Strata)

**The Key Insight:** Every role requires a certain time horizon of thinking. When someone's capability doesn't match their role's requirements, they fail - not from lack of effort, but from cognitive mismatch.

### Stratum Identification

#### Stratum I: Direct Output (1 day - 3 months)
**Typical Roles:** Front-line workers, clerks, operators
**Time Horizon:** Daily to quarterly tasks
**Thinking Pattern:** Follow procedures, solve immediate problems

**Assessment Questions:**
□ Can complete assigned tasks without constant supervision?
□ Focuses on today's work and this week's goals?
□ Solves problems within established procedures?
□ Comfortable with routine, predictable work?

#### Stratum II: Diagnostic Accumulation (3-12 months)
**Typical Roles:** Supervisors, team leads, senior technicians
**Time Horizon:** Quarterly to annual projects
**Thinking Pattern:** Coordinate resources, improve processes

**Assessment Questions:**
□ Can supervise others and coordinate work?
□ Sees patterns over several months?
□ Improves existing processes and systems?
□ Plans and executes projects up to one year?

#### Stratum III: Alternative Systems (1-2 years)
**Typical Roles:** Managers, department heads
**Time Horizon:** Annual to bi-annual strategic initiatives
**Thinking Pattern:** Create new systems, integrate functions

**Assessment Questions:**
□ Can design and implement new systems?
□ Thinks in 1-2 year strategic cycles?
□ Integrates multiple functions or departments?
□ Makes trade-offs between competing priorities?

#### Stratum IV: Parallel Systems (2-5 years)
**Typical Roles:** Directors, VPs, division heads
**Time Horizon:** Multi-year strategic planning
**Thinking Pattern:** Manage multiple parallel systems

**Assessment Questions:**
□ Can manage multiple complex systems simultaneously?
□ Plans 2-5 years into the future?
□ Balances short-term needs with long-term strategy?
□ Navigates ambiguity and complexity?

#### Stratum V: Unified Systems (5-10 years)
**Typical Roles:** Small company CEOs, EVPs
**Time Horizon:** Long-term organizational transformation
**Thinking Pattern:** Whole organization in its market context

**Assessment Questions:**
□ Can envision the organization 5-10 years out?
□ Understands total business ecosystem?
□ Makes decisions affecting entire enterprise?
□ Shapes organizational culture and capability?

### Time Span Capability Assessment Tool

**For Each Team Member, Evaluate:**

**Name: _________________ Current Role: _________________**

**1. Current Applied Capability (What they're demonstrating now)**
- Longest successful project managed: _______ months
- Planning horizon in current role: _______ months
- Complexity of problems solved: Stratum _______

**2. Potential Capability (With development and experience)**
- Could handle projects of: _______ months
- Shows thinking patterns of Stratum: _______
- Development needed: _______________________

**3. Role Requirements Analysis**
- Role requires Stratum: _______
- Time horizon needed: _______ months/years
- Complexity level: High / Medium / Low

**4. Capability-Role Fit Assessment**
□ **Green Light:** Capability exceeds role requirements
□ **Yellow Light:** Capability matches role (monitor for growth)
□ **Red Light:** Role exceeds capability (immediate attention needed)

### Common Time Span Mismatches

**The Peter Principle in Action:**
- Promoted from Stratum II to III without capability
- Great supervisor becomes failing manager
- Can't make the jump from tactical to strategic

**The Boredom Trap:**
- Stratum IV capability in Stratum II role
- High performer becomes disengaged
- Leaves for better opportunity

**The Founder's Dilemma:**
- Business grows beyond founder's time span
- Stratum III founder running Stratum V company
- Becomes the bottleneck to growth

## Key Warnings and Watch-Outs

### Time Span Pitfalls
1. **Don't promote based on performance alone** - High performance at Stratum II doesn't guarantee Stratum III capability
2. **Don't skip strata** - People rarely jump more than one stratum successfully
3. **Don't ignore boredom** - Under-utilized high capability people will leave

### Life Cycle Dangers
1. **Adolescence is the danger zone** - Most companies die here from founder-manager conflicts
2. **Premature aging is common** - Companies can age regardless of chronological age
3. **Bureaucracy is cancer** - Once it sets in, reversal is extremely difficult

### Integration Insights
1. **Capability must match stage** - Stratum II CEOs can't lead Prime organizations
2. **PAEI must evolve** - Yesterday's balance is today's dysfunction
3. **Growth requires both** - Time span capability AND life cycle evolution

## The Bottom Line

**Your business is stuck because:**
1. Your managers don't have the time span capability for their roles, OR
2. Your organization's life cycle stage demands different PAEI balance, OR
3. Both (most common)

**The solution:**
1. Assess honestly using these frameworks
2. Face the brutal facts about capability gaps
3. Make the tough people decisions
4. Develop systematically over time

**Remember:** Business growth requires both organizational evolution AND management capability development. You can't have one without the other.
