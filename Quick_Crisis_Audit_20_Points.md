## THE BRUTAL TRUTH

If you scored under 10 points, you don't have a businessâ€”you have an expensive job that's killing you. Either:

1. **Fix it NOW** - Implement every action item this week
2. **Get help NOW** - Bring in a partner or advisor
3. **Exit NOW** - Before it takes everything you have

There's no shame in admitting it's not working. There's only shame in letting it destroy your life.

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Calculate your score** (2 minutes)
2. **Identify your biggest red flag** (1 minute)
3. **Take the ONE action for that item TODAY** (varies)
4. **Schedule time to do this audit weekly until score >15** (recurring)

**Remember:** You can't think strategically when you're drowning. Fix the immediate bleeding first, then work on longer-term solutions.
