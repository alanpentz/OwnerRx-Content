# Marketing Hook Persona Testing Framework

## Testing Protocol

### Phase 1: Individual Persona Evaluation
Each persona agent evaluates each marketing hook independently, scoring on multiple dimensions.

### Phase 2: Comparative Analysis
Compare responses across personas to identify:
- Universal appeals (work for everyone)
- Segment-specific appeals (work for subgroups)
- Polarizing elements (loved by some, hated by others)

### Phase 3: Optimization Recommendations
Based on testing results, recommend hook modifications for maximum impact.
