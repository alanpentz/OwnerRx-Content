## Critical Decision Points

### The AI Opportunity
Session 6 revealed AI as "the tool I've been searching for since 2007" - this is a massive unlock for businesses and should be prominently featured.

### The Guilt vs Fear Distinction
Previous sessions covered money fear/scarcity. This session reveals guilt as different barrier - feeling "dirty" about success. Worth addressing separately.

### The Leadership Crisis Protocol
When someone publicly breaks, specific protocol needed. This is crisis management, not normal performance management.

---

## Notes

- Session 6 shows AI moving beyond automation to strategic intelligence
- Money guilt may affect successful founders more than struggling ones
- The "detective" energy type adds new dimension to flow state framework
- Leadership breaking points need immediate intervention protocols
