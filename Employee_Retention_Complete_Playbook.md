# Employee Retention Complete Playbook
## Why Turnover Is Healthy (And When It's Not)

### Executive Summary: Embrace Tours of Duty, Not Lifetime Employment

The modern reality is that employees, especially younger ones, will move around. Zero turnover means you're not pushing hard enough. Massive turnover means something's broken. The sweet spot is healthy turnover with the right people staying long enough to create value.

**Alan's Core Philosophy:** "Turnover is healthy. Particularly with younger employees, they're going to move around. I like Reid Hoffman's idea about tours of duty. Of course massive and continuing turnover is disruptive and means something is wrong but no turnover is bad. It means you aren't pushing to grow the company enough."

This playbook shows you how to retain who matters, accept natural turnover, and build systems that thrive with healthy employee movement.

## Alan's Final Retention Philosophy

"Stop trying to keep everyone forever. It's not natural, it's not healthy, and it's not possible in the modern world.

Embrace tours of duty. Make it clear: 'Come here, learn a ton, contribute value, and when it's time to move on, we'll help you do it well.' This honesty creates better relationships than false promises of lifetime employment.

But here's the critical part: Some people need to leave for the company to grow. The person who got you to $2M probably can't get you to $10M. Keeping them blocks everyone else and kills growth.

Turnover is healthy. It brings fresh perspectives, creates advancement opportunities, and prevents stagnation. No turnover means you're not pushing hard enough. Massive turnover means something's broken.

Focus on keeping your stars and high-potentials. Pay market rate to solid performers. Help poor performers leave quickly. And always, always make room for the talent that will take you to the next level.

Remember: The goal isn't to keep everyone. It's to keep the right people for the right amount of time. Sometimes the best thing you can do for someone—and for your company—is help them find their next opportunity.

Build a company that's a great place to be FROM, not just a great place to be AT."

**Remember:** Healthy turnover is a sign of growth. Unhealthy retention is a sign of stagnation. Know the difference and manage accordingly.
