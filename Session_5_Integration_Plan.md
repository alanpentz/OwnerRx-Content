# Session 5 Integration Plan
## Proposed Changes to OwnerRx Framework

---

## Summary of Session 5 Key Insights

**Coaching Context:**
- $4.2M B2B marketing agency owner
- Struggling with delegation and money mindset
- Doing too much operational work ($100/hour vs $10,000/hour)
- Childhood money trauma preventing investment in growth
- At strategic crossroads: acquire, replace self, or sell

**Major Themes Discovered:**
1. **Money Scarcity Programming** - Childhood financial trauma creating investment paralysis
2. **Owner Energy Discovery** - Finding what truly energizes founders (consolidated with existing Owner Energy concept)
3. **Platform vs Exit Framework** - Using business as vehicle for purpose
4. **The $100 vs $10,000 Hour Work** - Clear framework for delegation
5. **The Progressive Fear Ladder** - Why security is never enough

## Key Patterns to Emphasize

### The Scarcity-Growth Death Spiral
```
Won't Invest → Stay Small → Work Harder → Burn Out → Can't Think → Stay Small
```

### The Flow-Growth Success Cycle
```
Find Flow → Delegate Rest → Energy Increases → Better Decisions → Growth → More Resources → More Flow
```

### The Progressive Fear Ladder
```
Each level of success creates new insecurity target
Solution: Recognize pattern and break it
```
