# Team Evaluation Complete Playbook
## The Brutal Framework for Knowing Who to Keep, Develop, or Fire

### Executive Summary: Would You Enthusiastically Rehire Them?

Most team evaluation systems are complex HR theater that avoid the hard questions. This playbook gives you a simple, brutal framework that forces clarity about every team member. No hiding behind complicated metrics or lengthy reviews.

**Alan's Core Philosophy:** "Rate every team member high, medium, or low on past 6-month performance, potential to do the next role above them, and alignment with your values. Then ask: would I enthusiastically rehire this person? If they rank medium or low on one thing, can you fix it? If you wouldn't rehire them, why are they here?"

This is the evaluation system every owner must complete quarterly. It takes 30 minutes and will transform your team.

## The Three-Dimension Evaluation Matrix

> **Universal Business Insight #7: Meeting Transformation Rules**
> 
> **From Time Waste to Value Creation**
> 
> Most meetings are status updates that should be emails. Real meetings solve problems, make decisions, or create breakthroughs. Everything else is organizational theater that kills productivity.
> 
> **Universal Truth:** "A meeting without a decision is just an expensive conversation."

### The Only Three Things That Matter

**Dimension 1: Performance (Past 6 Months)**
- HIGH: Exceeds expectations consistently
- MEDIUM: Meets expectations 
- LOW: Below expectations

**Dimension 2: Potential (Next Role Up)**
- HIGH: Ready for promotion within 12 months
- MEDIUM: Could grow with development
- LOW: At ceiling in current role

**Dimension 3: Values Alignment**
- HIGH: Embodies company values
- MEDIUM: Generally aligned
- LOW: Values mismatch

### The Rehire Question

**The Ultimate Test:** "Would I enthusiastically rehire this person knowing what I know now?"

**Answer Options:**
- ABSOLUTELY: Keep and invest in them
- PROBABLY: Address specific issues
- UNSURE: Time-boxed improvement plan
- NO: Start exit planning

**Alan's Rule:** "If you wouldn't rehire them, why are they here?"

> **Universal Business Insight #23: The Darth Vader's Admiral Syndrome**
> 
> **Problem:** Setting good people up to fail in undefined roles
> 
> Promoting capable people into vague "right-hand" roles without clear success metrics is a death sentence. They'll excel briefly, then inevitably fail when expectations aren't clear. Define the role completely BEFORE promotion.
> 
> **Universal Truth:** "Great job for a while, but you're going to get killed at some point."

## The Job Description Foundation

### Outcome-Based Role Design

**Alan's Method:** "Think about what outcome for a customer or in support of someone delivering to a customer a position is responsible for. Then think backwards through all the outputs that position needs to deliver to create the outcome(s)."

### The Outcome-Output Framework

**Step 1: Define the Customer Outcome**
Examples:
- "Happy customer who received product on time"
- "Qualified leads that sales can convert"
- "Accurate financial reports for decision making"
- "Fully functional software without bugs"

**Step 2: Work Backwards to Required Outputs**
For "Happy customer who received product on time":
- Order processing within 2 hours
- Inventory accuracy maintained at 99%
- Shipping labels created same day
- Tracking information sent to customer
- Quality check completed before shipping

**Step 3: Create Accountability Metrics**
- Specific numbers attached to each output
- Clear measurement frequency
- Direct line from output to outcome
- No ambiguity about success

### Traditional vs. Outcome-Based Job Descriptions

**Traditional (Worthless):**
"Customer Service Representative responsible for:
- Answering customer inquiries
- Processing orders
- Maintaining customer relationships
- Supporting sales team"

**Outcome-Based (Powerful):**
"Customer Success Owner responsible for:
- OUTCOME: 95% customer satisfaction score
- OUTPUTS:
  - Respond to inquiries within 2 hours
  - Process orders with 99% accuracy
  - Generate 10 referrals monthly
  - Reduce churn by 20% quarterly"

## The Growth Reality Check

### When Good People Become Bottlenecks

**Alan's Hard Truth:** "Companies can grow faster than people. They hold on to employees that have outgrown their roles too long. These people are the number one reason companies don't grow, at least after the owner himself not growing."

### The 2-3X Turnover Rule

**The Uncomfortable Reality:**
"Every time the company 2-3x you need to turn over 50% of the top team."

**Why This Happens:**
- Skills that built $2M don't build $10M
- Complexity increases exponentially
- Market demands change
- Competitive landscape shifts
- Technology requirements evolve

### Managing the Transition

**What Doesn't Work:**
- **Demotion:** "They resent it"
- **Working Around Them:** "Warps everything else"
- **Hoping They'll Grow:** "You don't have time to wait"
- **Loyalty Over Performance:** "Kills the company"

**What Works:**
- Honest conversations early
- Generous severance packages
- Help finding next role
- Alumni relationship
- Clean, respectful exit

"Ask remote employees to make a Loom video summarizing what they worked on each day. Feed transcripts to LLMs for analysis."

"You have to have weekly check-ins with each remote employee."

**Remote-Specific Evaluation Criteria:**
- Communication quality and frequency
- Self-management ability
- Asynchronous collaboration
- Time zone flexibility

## Alan's Final Philosophy on Teams

"Employees act like children sometimes, as do owners. Start with what's right for the company. If people are fighting about something strategically important, great—encourage that as long as it's productive. If it's personal dynamics, I have low tolerance. Tell people to grow up or find another job.

The hard truth is that turnover is healthy. Particularly with younger employees, they're going to move around. No turnover means you aren't pushing to grow the company enough.

But the biggest mistake? Holding onto people who've outgrown their roles. They're the number one reason companies don't grow. You need to part ways with these people. It's unfortunate but it's reality.

Remember: Would you enthusiastically rehire this person? If not, why are they still here?

Your team is your company. Evaluate ruthlessly. Act decisively. Build the team that can build the future, not maintain the past."

**Remember:** This evaluation isn't about being nice or mean. It's about building a team that can achieve your vision. Every quarter you delay hard decisions costs you momentum, money, and morale.
