## The Family Succession Fantasy

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** What's the biggest lie or misconception about succession planning that even smart owners believe?

**ALAN:** If it's about your succession and passing it to your kids remember that this is your dream and the business should be designed to your zone of genius not your kids. If they want to buy it for a fair market value and you're willing to walk away fine but that's their choice. Eventually you will exit the business even if it's feet first so plan for it. Again run your business like you are always about to sell it and it will be easier to run and then when the time comes you'll have an easy time selling it.

**Key Truths:**
- Your dream ≠ your kids' dream
- Your genius ≠ their genius
- Everyone exits (even feet first)
- Run like selling tomorrow
- Fair market value or nothing

## Running Like You're Selling

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** You said "run it like you're always about to sell." What does that actually mean in practical terms?

**ALAN:** Build systems and processes that are documented and auditable. Know what your true profit is. If you are paying yourself a below market wage and running personal expenses through the business I'd stop doing that but at least account for that. Then start looking at ways to improve your business model. Can you productize things? Can you make cash flow better? Then figure out how to make the business less dependent on you. Can I structure it so I only work a few hours a week and then month? That's going to be valuable and more fun to run.

**The Sellable Business Checklist:**
1. **Systems:** Documented and auditable
2. **Financials:** True profit visible
3. **Compensation:** Market wage to yourself
4. **Business model:** Productized, better cash flow
5. **Owner dependence:** Hours/week → hours/month
6. **Result:** Valuable AND enjoyable

## From Hero to System

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Most owners can't imagine the business without them. What's the progression from "I am the business" to "it runs without me"?

**ALAN:** It's a process of system building and team building. You'll have to construct all of it. The real key is getting a qualified leadership team in place. This is hard to do and requires a lot of tough decisions along the way.

**The Progression:**
1. Build systems (document everything)
2. Build team (execute systems)
3. Build leaders (manage team)
4. Make tough decisions (who stays/goes)
5. Leadership team = freedom

## Inside vs Outside Leadership

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Internal succession (promoting from within) vs external sale - how should owners think about these options?

**ALAN:** If a company is growing quickly and doesn't have an experienced team in place, I recommend hiring from outside for key roles. Inside people haven't operated at that scale yet and don't know what to do. If you have an experienced team in place and a role opens up then you can promote from within and give a less experienced person a chance. You've got people to work with them and help compensate until they are up to speed.

**The Decision Matrix:**
- **Fast growth + inexperienced team:** Hire outside
- **Stable + strong team:** Promote inside
- **Key principle:** Can't lead where you've never been
- **Inside promotion:** Needs support structure
- **Outside hire:** Brings the roadmap

## The ONE Move That Matters

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Last question - what's the one succession planning move every owner should make NOW, even if they plan to run the business for 20 more years?

**ALAN:** Get a good leadership team around you.

**The Foundation:** Everything else is tactics. Leadership team is strategy.

## The ONE Thing

If an owner only does ONE thing about succession planning, what should it be?

**Build a leadership team now. Run the business like you're selling tomorrow. Document everything. Your exit is certain - only the timing is unknown.**
