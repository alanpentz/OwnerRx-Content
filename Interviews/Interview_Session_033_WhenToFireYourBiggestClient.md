**Pillar:** Sales/Strategy

## The Question

**Interviewer:** Alan, I often see businesses terrified of their biggest client. They're making good money but seem miserable. When should you actually fire your biggest client?

## Alan's Response

When they own you instead of pay you. Most businesses don't have a biggest client - they have a boss who lets them pretend to be independent. If losing one client would kill your business, you don't have a business. You have a job with extra paperwork.

Here's the test: Can you tell them no? If you can't say no to a client without fear of bankruptcy, they're not a client. They're your employer, and you're just too stupid to realize it.

## The 40% Rule

**Interviewer:** What's the tipping point where a client becomes too big?

No client should be more than 20% of revenue. At 30%, they start dictating terms. At 40%, they own you. At 50%, you're basically their employee. I've seen businesses with 70% concentration. That's not a business, it's a hostage situation.

The math is simple: If Client A is 40% of your revenue and they know it, every negotiation goes like this: "We need a 20% discount or we'll have to reconsider the relationship." What do you do? You cave. Because 80% of something beats 100% of nothing.

## The Concentration Trap

**Interviewer:** How do businesses end up in this situation?

**The Predictable Path:**

1. **Land a big client** - Celebration! We made it!
2. **They keep buying more** - Amazing! Look at this growth!
3. **Other clients seem small** - Why chase $5K when this client pays $50K?
4. **Stop prospecting** - We're too busy servicing the whale
5. **Client realizes their power** - Demands increase, margins decrease
6. **Too scared to say no** - They own you now
7. **They leave eventually** - You're destroyed

I watched a marketing agency go from $3M to $500K in one day when their 60% client left. They had to lay off 12 people. The owner went back to freelancing. Five years of building, gone in one email.

## When to Fire Them

**Interviewer:** So what are the specific triggers to fire a big client?

**Five Fire Triggers:**

**1. They're abusive**
Screaming, demeaning, threatening. Money doesn't buy the right to abuse. Ever.

**2. They're unprofitable**
When you run the real numbers - including stress cost - you're losing money.

**3. They block growth**
You can't take better clients because you're always serving them.

**4. They demand exclusivity**
"You can't work with any of our competitors" = employment, not consulting.

**5. They're over 40% of revenue**
Mathematical danger zone. Fire them or shrink them.

## The Firing Framework

**Interviewer:** How do you actually fire a major client without destroying your business?

**The 6-Month Exit Strategy:**

**Month 1-2: Fill the pipeline**
- Aggressive prospecting
- Reactivate old leads
- Network heavily
- Goal: 30 qualified opportunities

**Month 3-4: Convert new business**
- Close smaller clients
- Build revenue base
- Reduce concentration to 30%
- Create momentum

**Month 5: The conversation**
- "We're restructuring our service model"
- Give 60-90 day notice
- Offer to transition
- Be professional

**Month 6: Freedom**
- They're gone
- You survived
- You're diversified
- You own your business again

## Real Story: The $2M Fire

**Interviewer:** Can you share a specific example of this working?

Software development shop. $5M revenue. Biggest client was $2M (40%). Client was a nightmare - weekend calls, scope creep, verbal abuse, late payments. Owner was miserable, team was quitting.

We did the math: After allocating real costs, they were making 5% margin on this client versus 35% on others. The $2M client was actually worth $100K in profit. The $3M in other clients generated $1M in profit.

**The Decision:** Fire them.

**The Process:**
- Three months building pipeline
- Landed four new clients at $300-500K each
- Gave big client 90-day notice
- They threatened to sue (didn't)
- They begged to stay (said no)

**The Result:**
- Revenue dropped to $4M year one
- Profit increased to $1.2M (from $1.1M)
- Team morale skyrocketed
- Owner took first vacation in 3 years
- Year two: $6M revenue, $1.8M profit

Less revenue, more profit, better life.

## The Diversification Strategy

**Interviewer:** How do you prevent concentration problems from developing?

**The 10-10-10 Rule:**
- No client over 10% of revenue (ideal)
- Top 10 clients = 50% of revenue (max)
- Bottom 10 clients = 10% of revenue (prune these)

**Tactical Implementation:**
- Raise prices on big clients (they shrink or leave)
- Set maximum contract sizes
- Require multiple stakeholders
- Build recurring revenue base
- Say no to whale hunting

## The Psychological Barrier

The hardest part isn't financial - it's psychological. That big client makes you feel successful. They validate you. The big checks feel like winning. But it's false security.

Real security is 50 clients at $10K, not 1 client at $500K. The first is a business. The second is a dependency.

## The Client Portfolio Audit

**Monthly Questions:**
1. What percentage is my biggest client?
2. Could I survive if they left tomorrow?
3. Am I afraid to push back on them?
4. Are they getting better treatment than others?
5. When did I last tell them no?

If you don't like the answers, start your exit strategy today.

## The ONE Thing

**If losing one client would destroy your business, you don't have a business - you have a boss. No client should be over 20% of revenue. If they are, either shrink them or fire them. Your freedom is worth more than their check.**
