## The Problem with AI Responses

You ask for help with marketing and get: "Leverage your core competencies to create synergistic value propositions that resonate with your target demographic..."

Useless corporate word salad.

## The Core Insight

AI is incredibly smart and surprisingly dumb at the same time. Like that friend who can solve complex math problems but can't talk to a girl.

The key isn't getting fancier AI. It's getting better at asking for what you need.

## Four Strategies for Better AI Prompts

### 1. Be Extremely Specific

**Bad Prompt:**
"Help me with marketing"

**Good Prompt:**
"Write 3 Instagram posts for my coffee shop that make people want to visit on a rainy Tuesday. Target remote workers. Make it funny but not trying-too-hard funny."

The difference? Specificity. AI needs constraints to be creative.

### 2. Set the Context Thoroughly

Before asking for anything, explain:
- Who your customers are (demographics, psychographics, pain points)
- What makes your business unique (not "great service" - everyone says that)
- Your communication style (professional, casual, edgy, warm)
- What's worked before and what hasn't

**Example Context Setup:**
"I run a B2B software company selling to stressed-out CFOs at mid-market companies. They're drowning in spreadsheets and scared of making mistakes. Our tool automates their month-end close. We communicate like helpful experts, not salespeople."

### 3. Ask Diagnostic Questions First

Before jumping to solutions, ask AI to understand your situation:

"What are 3 things you need to know about my situation to give me actually useful advice?"

Let AI interview you. It's surprisingly good at identifying what context it's missing.

### 4. Always Request Critical Feedback

End every strategy request with:
"What could go wrong with this approach? What am I not considering?"

AI won't hurt your feelings. Use that. Get it to poke holes in your plans before reality does.

## Examples That Actually Work

### Sales Email
"Write a cold email to a VP of Sales who's probably getting 50 emails a day. Make it 3 sentences max. Reference their recent LinkedIn post about missing quota. Don't use any of these words: synergy, leverage, innovative, cutting-edge."

### Customer Service Response
"Reply to an angry customer who's been waiting 3 days for support. Acknowledge we screwed up. Don't make excuses. Offer something concrete to make it right. Sound like a human who actually cares, not a corporate robot."

### Strategic Planning
"I'm a solo consultant making $200k/year working 60 hours a week. Give me 3 specific ways to hit $300k while working 40 hours. Consider that I hate managing people and I'm good at strategy but terrible at execution."

## The Bottom Line

Stop blaming AI for giving you generic answers. You're asking generic questions.

Be specific. Set context. Ask for diagnosis. Request criticism.

The tool is smart enough. The question is: are you?
