## The Question

**Interviewer:** Alan, I see businesses constantly underpricing their services. They know they should charge more but can't seem to pull the trigger. What's really going on psychologically, and how do you break through it?

## Alan's Response

Pricing is 20% math and 80% psychology. Most entrepreneurs price based on their own wallet, not their customer's value. They think, "I wouldn't pay that," forgetting they're not the customer. 

The deeper issue? Imposter syndrome. They don't believe they're worth more. So they hide behind low prices, thinking it makes them safe. But low prices attract worst customers, create cash problems, and build resentment. You end up hating the business because you're overdelivering for people who don't value you.

## The Price Confidence Test

**Interviewer:** How can someone tell if they're underpriced?

**Five Signs You're Too Cheap:**

1. **Nobody negotiates.** If everyone says yes immediately, you're leaving money on the table.

2. **You resent your customers.** You see what they drive, where they vacation, and think "I'm helping them get richer while I struggle."

3. **Customers don't implement.** Free and cheap advice gets ignored. Expensive advice gets acted on.

4. **You're busy but broke.** Full calendar, empty bank account.

5. **Referrals dry up.** Nobody brags about their cheap vendor. They brag about their expensive consultant.

If you have 3+ of these, you're underpriced by at least 50%.

## The Pricing Breakthrough Story

**Interviewer:** Can you share a specific example of someone breaking through their pricing ceiling?

Consultant charging $2K/month. Good results, miserable life. Working 60 hours, making $120K. We did the math - clients were getting $50K+ monthly value. She was capturing 4% of value created.

First, we tested. One new prospect: "My fee is $6K/month." They said yes without blinking. She almost threw up. Next prospect: $8K. Yes again. Finally landed at $12K/month. Lost 60% of prospects but tripled revenue with 40% of the work.

Here's what happened next - the $12K clients were better. They implemented faster, complained less, referred more. The $2K clients? They were price shoppers. The $12K clients were value seekers. Different species.

## The Pricing Psychology Map

**What's Really Happening in Your Head:**

**Fear #1: "They'll say no"**
Reality: Some will. Good. Wrong clients saying no is a gift.

**Fear #2: "I'll lose all my customers"**
Reality: You'll lose the worst ones. The best ones already think you're too cheap.

**Fear #3: "Competitors will undercut me"**
Reality: Let them have the price shoppers while you serve value seekers.

**Fear #4: "I'm not worth it"**
Reality: You're not selling your time, you're selling their outcome.

**Fear #5: "The market won't bear it"**
Reality: The market is segmented. There's always a premium segment.

## The Price Increase Playbook

**Interviewer:** What's your systematic approach to raising prices?

**The 90-Day Price Evolution:**

**Days 1-30: Test with new prospects**
- Keep existing clients at old price
- Quote 50% higher to new prospects
- Track close rate
- Adjust up or down

**Days 31-60: Create premium tier**
- Add high-touch version at 3x price
- Include exclusive access/bonuses
- Test with best clients
- One yes validates model

**Days 61-90: Migrate existing clients**
- Grandfather for 6 months
- Explain new value adds
- Offer payment terms
- Let wrong clients leave

**Critical: Never apologize for price increases. Frame as investment in better service.**

## The Value Stacking Method

**How to Justify Higher Prices:**

Don't just raise price - raise value perception:

**Before:** "Consulting - $2,000/month"

**After:** 
"Strategic Advisory Partnership - $6,000/month
- Weekly strategy calls ($2,000 value)
- Unlimited email access ($1,000 value)  
- Quarterly planning session ($2,500 value)
- Resource library ($500 value)
- Partner network access ($1,000 value)
Total Value: $8,000
Your Investment: $6,000"

Same service, different framing, 3x price.

## The Premium Positioning Formula

**Three Elements of Premium Pricing:**

**1. Specific Target:** "I only work with..." Exclusivity creates value.

**2. Defined Outcome:** "You will achieve..." Certainty commands premium.

**3. Unique Method:** "Using my proprietary..." Different is worth more than better.

Example: "I only work with SaaS companies between $1-5M (specific) to reduce churn below 5% (outcome) using my Retention Acceleration Framework (method)."

Generic version: "I help businesses keep customers." Worth 10x less.

## The Client Quality Paradox

**Interviewer:** You mentioned $12K clients were better than $2K clients. Why does that happen?

Price is a filter. High prices filter for:
- Commitment (they're invested)
- Sophistication (they understand value)
- Resources (they can implement)
- Urgency (they need results now)
- Respect (they value expertise)

Low prices filter for:
- Price shoppers
- Tire kickers
- DIYers who want validation
- People with no budget
- Complainers and negotiators

You don't just get paid more with premium pricing - you get better clients who get better results which builds better reputation which justifies higher prices. It's a virtuous cycle.

## The Anchor Price Strategy

Always present your highest price first. It reframes everything else.

"My comprehensive program is $50K. For those not ready for that investment, I have a workshop for $5K."

$5K seems reasonable after $50K. Present $5K first and it seems expensive.

## The ONE Thing

**Stop pricing based on your personal comfort and start pricing based on client value. Test 50% higher with new prospects this week. The worst that happens? They say no and you learn. The best? You discover you've been undervalued for years.**
