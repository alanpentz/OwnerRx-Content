## Session Highlights & Key Insights

### Session 1: Ideal Customer Profile (Sales & Marketing)
**Revolutionary Insight:** "Don't niche down just to niche - let the data tell you"

**Key Takeaways:**
- The prestige trap: Boring customers beat sexy ones
- Your real ICP: Cheapest to acquire, easiest to serve, most abundant
- The Smile Test: "Which customers make you smile vs cringe?"
- Quick method: Rank by revenue, score by joy and repeatability

**The ONE Thing:** Look for customers who check ALL boxes - you like them, there's lots more, they stay, they buy enough

### Session 2: Bottleneck Resolution (Operations)
**Revolutionary Insight:** "The bottleneck might be hiding just outside your tracking system"

**Key Takeaways:**
- Stop throwing bodies at bottlenecks - subordinate first
- Software example: Developers doing admin while testers test
- Find bottlenecks: Look where work piles up (even outside systems)
- Zero-cost fix: Strip everything non-essential from bottleneck

**The ONE Thing:** Find where work piles up and take everything off the bottleneck's plate that isn't essential

### Session 3: Hiring & Onboarding (Team)
**Revolutionary Insight:** "Can AI do this to 85% effectiveness? Then don't hire"

**Key Takeaways:**
- New hiring sequence: AI first, global second, local last
- $60K marketing lead → $20/month Claude subscription
- Think outcomes not roles: "10 leads per week" not "marketing person"
- Global talent: Use agency first, then go direct

**The ONE Thing:** Define outcomes and outputs - creates clarity about what you actually need

---

### Session 4: Cash Flow Management (Finance)
**Revolutionary Insight:** "The money in your bank account is NOT yours"

**Key Takeaways:**
- Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, cash is king
- Horror stories: Tax loans and payroll panics are predictable
- 13-week simplified: Track big chunks, add 25% buffer
- Fire your bookkeeper if books are months behind (especially if it's you)

**The ONE Thing:** Get a better bookkeeper for data, then collect payments faster

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### 1. Data Over Assumptions
- ICP: Let data tell you who to serve
- Bottlenecks: Look at actual queues
- Hiring: Measure if AI hits 85%
- Cash: You need real-time numbers

### 2. Simplification Beats Sophistication
- ICP: 30-minute spreadsheet analysis
- Bottlenecks: Just strip non-essentials
- Hiring: Outcomes not job descriptions
- Cash: Track big chunks, not every penny

### 3. Uncomfortable Truths
- Your best customers might be boring
- Senior people might need to do admin work
- Most roles can be automated or globalized
- Your bookkeeper probably sucks

### 4. The One-Two Punch Pattern
- First: Get visibility (data/measurement)
- Second: Take the obvious action
- Examples: Bookkeeper then collections, Find bottleneck then strip tasks
