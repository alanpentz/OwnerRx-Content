Why every business owner should experiment with AI development tools before their competitors do

üì¢¬†AI will do to agencies and professional services what the Internet and Social did to newspapers and journalism. A few agencies will grow bigger but most will die and be replaced by new entrants using agents, data, and community to niche down and differentiate. Our webinar will focus on the trends driving this transition and the tools agencies need to start using to be one of the survivors.

**TL;DR**: What used to take developers weeks and cost thousands now takes hours and costs under $5. I built 5 custom web pages and lite applications for my business using only AI assistants and no-code tools‚Äîno programming knowledge required. From cash flow trackers to pricing calculators, these tools now serve as lead magnets on my website. The competitive advantage goes to business owners who start experimenting now, before everyone figures this out.

While waiting for the OwnerRx alpha to launch (probably in two weeks!), I‚Äòve been experimenting with different things I can do with AI tools to help build my new company.

Turns out, the answer is ‚Äúway more than I expected.‚Äù

As I‚Äôve said, I‚Äôm not a programmer. I can barely spell JavaScript.

But using AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and simple platforms like Replit, I‚Äôve been building amazing interactive web content.

The AI content revolution is here and it‚Äôs not dreck. It‚Äôs incredibly useful information. You can see the early results live on the OwnerRx website.

**Cash Flow Tracker**** - **Track your business cash flow patterns and identify potential cash crunches before they happen.

**LLM SEO Mastery**** - **Master optimization for AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Perplexity. Learn the future of search.

**Small Business Coaching Guide**** - **Compare EOS, Scaling Up, Strategic Coach, Value Builder & ActionCOACH. Find the perfect coaching system for your business.

**AI Tools for Small Business**** - **Complete guide for busy business owners to implement AI without technical expertise. Practical examples, costs, and step-by-step instructions.

These range from simple webpages to interactive web pages to full on web apps with a database and AI calls.

Here‚Äôs what blew my mind: Each of these took between 15 minutes and 2-3 hours to build.

Not 2-4 weeks. Not 2-4 months. Minutes to hours.

The AI handles the coding. I handle the business logic and user experience. Together, we can create functional software faster than most companies can schedule a planning meeting.

I focused on what I call ‚Äúlite apps‚Äù - tools that solve one problem really well without complicated features:

No user accounts to manage

No complex databases to maintain

No security nightmares to solve

Just simple inputs, smart processing, useful outputs

Think calculator, not operating system.

I‚Äôve developed a simple system. Ask ChatGPT and Gemini for relatively high volume searches in your target area but with poorly rated answers. If you want to be extra cool, have it identify searches on ChatGPT that are growing but have poorly rated answers.

It will tell you the searches and exactly why the answers were poorly rated. Then do deep research reports in ChatGPT or Gemini to develop the basic content.

Plug that back into your favored AI and ask it to make it the type of content your audience would want. That means slimming it down to the key points and making them digestible.

I review the results, make some edits, and then ask Replit to turn it into an interactive webpage. A few tests and tweaks later it‚Äôs deployed on the website.

Replit is a game changer. It builds web pages and apps just using prompts, no coding necessary.

I did build one complex app - a cash flow tracker that saves your data over time.

It was a nightmare. Since it‚Äôs financial data, I needed an encrypted database. That required a better third party database and authentication system than Replit had. That made Replit mad and I spent an hour or two working out the kinks.

I got it working but the sign on process is quirky. Try it. Sometimes if it‚Äôs the first time it‚Äôs seen your email domain, it has you sign up but says the app isn‚Äôt available. If you log in again, it‚Äôll let you in.

But even with that hassle it just took 2-3 hours and some perseverance and patience.

Lesson learned: If you want to move fast, keep it simple.

If I can find gaps and build this kind of content this quickly without programming knowledge, what could you build for your specific industry?

That custom calculator your customers always ask for? A few hours of work.

The assessment tool that would help prospects understand their problems? Afternoon project.

The simple automation that would save your team 5 hours a week? Done by dinner.

While your competitors are debating whether to ‚Äúinvest in technology,‚Äù you could be building the exact tools your business needs.

No waiting for IT departments. No massive software budgets. No lengthy vendor evaluations.

Just identify a problem, spend a few hours with AI, and solve it.

You have an inherent advantage over bigger companies. They will resist this and don‚Äôt have approval systems that can adapt to the pace.

It‚Äôll take someone at a Fortune 500 company longer to figure out who runs the website than it will take you to make and deploy 5 interactive webpages.

The hardest part isn‚Äôt the technical stuff - AI handles that.

The hardest part is thinking clearly about what you want the tool to do:

What inputs does it need?

What calculations should it perform?

What outputs would be most useful?

How should it look and feel?

Business logic, not programming logic.

When something doesn‚Äôt work right, you don‚Äôt need to call a developer and wait weeks for changes. You just need to keep trying.

You describe what‚Äôs wrong to the AI, it fixes the code, and you‚Äôre back to testing in minutes.

This feedback loop accelerates improvement dramatically.

Total cost for building this content? Maybe $3-5 in Replit fees.

Compare that to what agencies charge for custom development: it‚Äôs tens of thousands.

Once built, these tools become lead magnets, customer resources, and competitive differentiators.

Put them on your website. Share them with prospects. Use them to demonstrate expertise.

Each tool that solves a real problem becomes a reason for customers to choose you over competitors.

This is just the beginning. AI development tools are improving monthly.

What takes me 4 hours today will take 1 hour next year or maybe 10 minutes. What requires basic technical knowledge today will be completely no-code tomorrow.

Business owners who start experimenting now will have a massive advantage over those who wait.

Eventually everyone will figure it out and the advantage will erode.

Stop thinking ‚ÄúI need to hire someone to build that.‚Äù

Start thinking ‚ÄúI need to spend a weekend learning how to build that myself.‚Äù

The tools are available. The AI is ready to help. The only question is whether you‚Äôre ready to experiment.

Pick one question your customers ask. Research it with AI and then have Replit, Bolt, or Lovable build it into an interactive webpage.

Or find a repetitive task in your business. Something you do manually that could be automated. Describe it to ChatGPT or Claude. Ask it to help you build a simple tool to solve it.

Start simple. Learn by doing. Build your first app this week. Don‚Äôt wait.

The future belongs to business owners who can create their own solutions, not just buy them.
