## The "Be Everywhere" Myth

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** What's the biggest lie or misconception about marketing channels that even smart owners believe?

**ALAN:** That you need to cover all of them or even a lot of them.

**Key Insight:** Ten channels done poorly < Two channels done well. Stop spreading yourself thin.

## Let Your Customers Choose

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** If a B2B service business under $5M had to pick just TWO channels to focus on, what should they be and why? Not theory - what actually works.

**ALAN:** I shouldn't pick, your customers should. Go where they are. For B2B professional services that is likely to be LinkedIn but you need to understand it yourself.

**Revolutionary Truth:**
- Don't pick channels based on gurus
- Go where YOUR customers already are
- B2B = usually LinkedIn
- You must understand it yourself (can't fully outsource)

## The Email List Reality

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Everyone says "email marketing" but most small businesses have garbage email lists. What's the fastest way to build an email list that actually converts, not just vanity subscriber numbers?

**ALAN:** There are lots of email lists and tools to clean them. AI is now bringing in even more sophistication with tools like Clay that add enrichment. The tools are out there.

**The Practical Approach:**
- Buy lists (purists hate this)
- Clean them with tools
- Enrich with AI (Clay, etc.)
- Skip the slow organic build
- Tools exist - use them

## Cold Outreach That Works

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Cold outreach - email, LinkedIn, whatever. Most owners either don't do it (scared) or do it badly (spam). What's the approach that actually works without burning reputation?

**ALAN:** I'm working on looking at influencers in my area on LinkedIn. First I comment on their posts and then reach out with DMs designed to be helpful. There are lots of funnel and nurturing sequences out there. Do the research on what's best for your target.

**The Warm-Cold Method:**
1. Identify influencers in your space
2. Comment on their posts first
3. Build visibility before reaching out
4. Send helpful DMs, not sales pitches
5. Research what works for YOUR specific target

**Key:** Relationship before reach-out

## The Ignored Goldmine

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Last question - what marketing channel do most small businesses completely ignore that's actually a goldmine for the right business?

**ALAN:** I think email.

**The Irony:** Everyone talks about email, nobody does it well. It's hiding in plain sight.

## The ONE Thing

If an owner only does ONE thing about marketing channels, what should it be?

**Pick the ONE channel where your customers actually spend time and master it completely before adding a second. For B2B, it's probably LinkedIn. For everyone, email is the ignored goldmine.**

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Depth over breadth** - Two channels well > ten channels poorly
2. **Customers choose channels** - Go where they are, not where you want them
3. **Buy and clean lists** - Faster than organic, tools make it work
4. **Warm up cold outreach** - Comment first, help second, sell never (initially)
5. **Email is ignored** - Everyone talks about it, nobody masters it
6. **Understand it yourself** - Can't fully outsource channel strategy
