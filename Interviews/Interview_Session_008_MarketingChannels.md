## Interview Opening

I've noticed you write a lot about marketing channels - the allure of new platforms, the reality of what works, the trap of spreading too thin. Let's dig into your unfiltered views on marketing channels for small businesses.

## Key Insights Captured

### 1. The Spreading Too Thin Trap

**Alan's First Mistake:**
"The first mistake is spreading yourself too thin. You should nail one channel at a time. It requires focus to master just one channel."

**The Focus Reality:** Master one before adding another.

### 2. The Unfocused Strategy Problem

**Alan's Second Mistake:**
"The second is an unfocused strategy. In the AI content world it takes more nurturing to get leads to convert."

**The Ownership Principle:**
"You need to go beyond just social posting to developing owned channels like newsletters and communities."

**The Forgotten Basic:**
"Getting out and meeting customers for bigger ticket sales is often overlooked in our AI driven world."

**Key Insight:** AI-generated content needs MORE nurturing, not less. And nothing beats face-to-face for big deals.

### 2. The Channel-Business Match Reality

**Alan's Critical Distinction:**
"We need to distinguish by type of business."

**The Channel Playbook by Business Type:**

**Professional Services:**
"If it's professional services LinkedIn rocks."

**B2C:**
"If it's B2C it's Meta and TikTok."

**Local Business:**
"If it's a local business it's Google Ads and in particular Google reviews."

**The SEO Decline:**
"SEO still works but it is losing out every day to GEO and it's unclear how good GEO will be."

**Local Professional Services:**
"If you are a local professional services company going to lunch with people is great marketing."

**Manufacturing:**
"Many manufacturing companies still do great at industry trade shows."

**The Bottom Line:**
"Marketing is where the answers for businesses are the most diverse."

**Key Insight:** Stop looking for universal answers. Your business type determines your channel, period.

### 3. The Channel Mastery Playbook

**Alan's Research Phase:**
"Start with deep research reports from LLMs on the channel. Then work with the LLM to tailor the information to your company."

**The YouTube University:**
"Go on YouTube and find people talking about how to be successful in that channel."

**Define Success Concretely:**
"Then try to come up with the specific outcome you want and use your research to ground it. I need X leads per week or month."

**The Mindset Shift:**
"Marketing is just a process and a game you need to learn."

**The Expert Hack:**
"I also recommend that people find experts on sites like Upwork and Fiverr. You can usually pay for 30-60 minutes of their time to get feedback and upgrades on your plan."

**The Agency Warning:**
"You can use consultants and agencies but I recommend getting a specialist in the narrow channel you plan to use. Don't go with multi-service agencies. They are average at everything."

**The Protection Strategy:**
"But you need to get to knowledge level that allows you to be an informed consumer and focus on keeping contract terms short so you can get out of the contract if it's not working."

**Key Insight:** Use AI for research, YouTube for tactics, $100 expert calls for shortcuts, and never sign long contracts with generalists.

### 4. The Only Metric That Matters

**Alan's Brutal Simplicity:**
"You should track conversions to a sales call or sales process. Doesn't matter if that's Google Ads or conference attendance."

**The Universal Truth:** Everything else is noise. Count how many people enter your sales process.

**Key Insight:** Forget impressions, clicks, and engagement. One number: How many sales conversations did this channel create?

## The ONE Thing (Alan's Final Answer)

**If you only do one thing:**
"Start analyzing what the best people using that tactic are doing."

**The Research Reality:**
"There's almost always a best practice you can find doing deep research or watching some YouTube videos."

**Why This Works:**
- Someone already figured it out
- Best practices are hiding in plain sight
- YouTube has tutorials for everything
- You don't need to reinvent the wheel
- Success leaves clues

**The Bottom Line:** Stop guessing. Find who's crushing it in your channel and copy them.
