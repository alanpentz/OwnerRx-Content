He's just going to get better and better

**While working on the third version of my Business Health Assessment for the upcoming OwnerRx app, I had a sudden realization:**

Why was I building a static assessment?

They kind of suck. You answer question after question, and then 15–20 minutes later you get some kind of result. It’s very 2010s.

Why couldn’t my assessment be a strategy conversation?

That’s what I do with clients on Zoom. I don’t ask them 30 questions, disappear for 10 minutes, and come back with a monologue.

I have a conversation.

Traditional business assessments treat your company like a math problem:
Answer these questions, get your score, follow these steps.

But here’s the thing—your business isn't a math problem. It’s a living, breathing organism that changes by the hour.

That customer who just threatened to leave?
The employee who’s about to quit?
The cash flow crisis that showed up this morning?

None of that fits into a neat little assessment box.

I’ve been testing something completely different.

Instead of forcing you through static workflows, we’re creating an AI business coach that actually *thinks* with you in real time.

Meet **Rx**—our prototype AI coach that I’ve been putting through its paces. This isn’t some chatbot that spits out generic advice. This is a seasoned business partner who’s been in the trenches, knows how to ask the right questions, and isn’t afraid to challenge your thinking.

The difference? Rx doesn’t just assess your business—it helps you uncover what you already know but haven’t connected yet.

Instead of:
**“Rate your marketing on a scale of 1–10”**
Rx asks:
**“What’s the one marketing thing that, if you fixed it in the next 30 days, would make the biggest difference?”**

Instead of:
**“Complete this 12-step strategic planning process”**
Rx asks:
**“Before we go deep, what would make the biggest difference in the next 90 days for YOU personally?”**

It’s coaching, not assessment.
And the coaching gets better the more it knows about you.

It’s still just a GPT—it can’t remember you from session to session, and I can only guide it with so much data.

But it’s a pretty awesome glimpse of what the final tool will be like.

I’m opening up limited access to test Rx for the first 50 people who respond. You can sign up here and **remember to check your spam folder**.

If you want to experience what business coaching feels like when it’s actually designed for how your brain works, just reply with **“SEND IT”** and I’ll get you access.

Fair warning: This isn’t for everyone.
If you prefer worksheets and homework, stick with the old way.

But if you’re ready for a business coach that actually gets how you think...
