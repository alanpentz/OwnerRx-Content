## Key Insights Captured

## Current Interview Progress

### 3. The Back-of-Envelope Prevention System

**Alan's Dead Simple Method:**
"Most cash drains are large: payroll, big vendors and service providers and cash intake is dependent on customer billing terms and your ability and focus on collections."

**Step 1: Collections First**
"First thing to do is prioritize bugging customers to pay. Emails and calls work and keep the pressure on. The squeaky wheel gets the grease as they say."

**Step 2: The Envelope Math**
1. Take current cash in the bank
2. List major expenses this month: "Payroll? vendor payments? service providers?"
3. List who's going to pay you and when
4. Total cash in and out
5. "Start working on how to push out payment and push up collections"

**Key Insight:** It's not about sophisticated forecasting - it's about knowing the big chunks and working the timing.

### 4. The 13-Week Cash Flow (Simplified)

**Alan's Simplification:**
"They are complex because we want to track every single expense. Just focus on the big ones and then do a plug figure for the rest."

**The Only Things That Matter:**
1. Payroll
2. Major vendor payments
3. Service provider payments
4. Rent
5. Materials (if applicable)
6. Tax payments
7. **Everything else:** "Just add a buffer of 25% or so"

**Key Point:** "I think most owners know the rough order of magnitude of these payments so they can estimate"

**Alan's Brutal Truth About Bookkeepers:**
"Most CPAs are chronically behind and they are focused on doing tax returns not understanding 13 week cash flow. Get a better bookkeeper. If your books are months behind you are driving blind. Fire your bookkeeper (especially if it's you) and get someone better."

## The ONE Thing (Alan's Final Answer)

**If you only do one thing (actually two):**
1. "First get a better bookkeeper so you have data"
2. "Second collect payments faster. More cash sooner solves lots of problems."

**Why This Works:**
- Without data, you're blind
- With faster collections, most problems disappear
- These two changes fix 80% of cash flow issues

**The Bottom Line:** You can't manage what you can't see, and you can't spend what you haven't collected.
