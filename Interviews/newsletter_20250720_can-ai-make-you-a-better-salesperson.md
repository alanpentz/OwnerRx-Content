Can AI Make You A Better Salesperson?

It Sure As Hell Did For Me. (15-Min Tool Inside)

I'm about to show you how to build an AI sales coach in 15 minutes flat.

But first, let me tell you why you need one.

**My brutal wake-up call:**

Few months back, I fed my sales call transcripts to a custom GPT I built. It graded me 5 or 6 categories, each scored 1-5.

Building rapport: 4.5 ✓

Understanding customer needs: 4.8 ✓

Connecting solutions to pain: 4.3 ✓

Clear Call to Action: 2.5 ✗

Turns out I'm great at making friends, not so good at closing deals.

The AI called me out: "You built great rapport but ended with 'let's circle back' instead of scheduling the next meeting. No timeline. You left money on the table."

Ouch. But also... exactly what I needed to hear.

My closing score: 4.1 (up from 2.5)

Close rate: Up 9 percentage points

All because an AI told me what every sales coach already knew - I wasn't asking for the business.

**Now let me show you how to build your own (15 minutes, tops):**

**Step 1: Set up transcript capture (3 min)**

Install Fathom (free forever) or Otter.ai (300 min/month free)

Connect to Zoom/Meet/Teams

Done. Every call now auto-transcribes.

**Step 2: Create your Sales Coach GPT (5 min)**

Open ChatGPT Plus (in your browser not in the desktop) → Explore GPTs → "Create"

Name it: "[YourCompany] Sales Coach"

Paste this instruction set:

You are a direct but constructive sales coach. Evaluate sales call transcripts using this rubric:

Score each category 1-5:
1. Rapport & Discovery - Did we uncover real business pain?
2. Authority Check - Did we identify decision makers?
3. Value Articulation - Did we connect our solution to their pain?
4. Objection Handling - Did we address concerns effectively?
5. Closing Momentum - Did we set clear next steps with dates?
6. Listening Ratio - Did we talk less than 45% of the time?
7. Social Proof - Did we use relevant case studies?
8. Call Structure - Did we follow a logical flow?

Output:
- Score table (all 8 categories)
- Specific examples of what went well/poorly
- ONE big improvement for next call
- Exact script change to implement

Be brutally honest but actionable. Bonus points for running a deep research report on sales best practices and uploading that to the GPT. That’s what mine is working off of but the prompt above is almost as good.

I thought adding the line about suggesting one big improvement really helped me with the output. Sometimes a lot of advice can be overwhelming.

**Step 3: Grade your first call (7 min)**

Export transcript from Fathom/Otter

Prompt the GPT: "Evaluate this sales call transcript"

Get roasted (constructively)

**Step 4: Actually use the feedback**

Add the suggested script change to your call outline

Focus on improving your lowest score

**That's it. You now have a 24/7 sales coach.**

Want to skip the setup? Here's my exact GPT you can use: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-682b5f8ae4e88191ad89bb6e7e860b7d-sales-feedback-coach

I don’t see the data so don’t worry about that.

But honestly? Build your own. Customize the rubric for your business. Add categories that matter to you. Make it yours. That’s what AI is for.

This isn't about the tool. It's about getting objective feedback on every single call instead of guessing what went wrong.

While your competition wonders why deals stall, you'll know exactly what to fix.

And unlike a human coach, this one never sleeps and costs less than your Netflix subscription.

P.S. First person to reply with their sales scores gets my advanced GPT that also drafts follow-up emails based on the call. Just saying.
