## The Board Theater Problem

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** What's the biggest lie or misconception about advisory boards or personal boards that even smart owners believe?

**ALAN:** They don't usually work for small companies. Owners confuse what they are for. Are they marketing boards that help open doors, are they real governance boards? You are the only shareholder so that is weird. I've never used them. I like to have a coach and some outside confidants that I check in with. I do think as a company grows and particularly when it prepares for exit a board makes sense. Obviously with investors on board, they want a board to protect the investment.

**Key Insight:** 
- Small company boards = confused purpose
- Marketing board? Governance board? Neither works
- You're the only shareholder = no real accountability
- Better: Coach + trusted confidants
- Boards make sense only for exit prep or investor protection

## Finding a Real Coach

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** You mentioned coaches and confidants. What's the difference between a coach who actually helps vs one who just takes your money? How do owners choose the right one?

**ALAN:** What's their experience? How have they measurably helped others? What's their process? I tend to find most coaches don't have experience in what they are coaching and that's an issue. You've got to kiss a lot of frogs to find a prince.

**The Coach Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Experience:** Have they done what you're trying to do?
- **Results:** Measurable help to others
- **Process:** Clear methodology, not just chat
- **Reality:** Most coaches lack real experience
- **Testing:** Kiss frogs to find princes

## The Right Confidants

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Besides a coach, you mentioned "outside confidants." Who should these people be and what role do they actually play?

**ALAN:** I like to be in business owner groups like EO and YPO. There's also Hampton and Vistage. Then if you can get a good corporate lawyer that's great as well.

**The Confidant Stack:**
- **Peer groups:** EO, YPO, Hampton, Vistage
- **Key:** Other owners with similar challenges
- **Legal counsel:** Good corporate lawyer who's seen it all
- **Not:** Friends who haven't built businesses
- **Not:** Family who don't understand the pressure

## The Forum Secret

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Most owners join these groups but don't get value. What's the difference between using these groups effectively vs just showing up for meetings?

**ALAN:** Forums are the real key. Join a peer forum.

**The Forum Difference:**
- Small group within the larger organization
- 6-8 people who meet regularly
- Deep trust develops over time
- Real problems get discussed
- Big meetings = networking, Forums = transformation

## The Essential Relationship

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Last question - what's the one relationship every owner should invest in that most don't, that actually moves the needle?

**ALAN:** A coach. All great performers have coaches. They know you like a board won't and they'll push you if they are good.

**Why Coaches Beat Boards:**
- Personal knowledge of you
- Will push when needed
- No politics or posturing
- All great performers have them
- Accountability without theater

## The ONE Thing

If an owner only does ONE thing about building their personal board, what should it be?

**Find a coach who has actually done what you're trying to do. Join a peer forum in EO/YPO/Vistage. Skip the advisory board unless you're preparing to exit.**

2. **Coach > Board** - Personal accountability beats committee
3. **Experience matters** - Coach must have done it, not just studied it
4. **Kiss frogs** - Most coaches are bad, keep looking
5. **Forums are key** - Small group trust beats big meetings

## For the Playbook Update

### Replace Advisory Board Fantasy With:
- Coach + confidants model
- Peer forums for real support
- Boards only for exit/investors
- Experience-based selection

### Add Specific Examples:
- EO/YPO forums = 6-8 owners meeting monthly
- Coach evaluation: "Show me who you've helped"
- Board confusion: Marketing vs governance vs pretend
- Corporate lawyer = pattern recognition advisor

### New Tools Needed:
- Coach evaluation checklist
- Peer group comparison guide
- Forum effectiveness audit
- Confidant mapping exercise

### Critical Warnings:
- Most coaches lack real experience
- Advisory boards = expensive theater
- Big meetings â‰  value
- Forums require commitment
- Test multiple coaches before committing
