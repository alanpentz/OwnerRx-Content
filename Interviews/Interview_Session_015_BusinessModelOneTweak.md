### Topic: Business Model One-Tweak Optimization

**Q: What is your "one-tweak" methodology?**

A: My idea is to keep making small changes to your business model. Do one thing at a time, experiment and see what works. Massive overhauls should be very rare if ever.

**Q: How do you decide WHICH tweak to test first?**

A: I like to link it to the crux in the business strategy section if possible, or if not to a major issue.

**Q: How long do you run a one-tweak experiment?**

A: That's very specific to what you are changing.

**Q: Can you give a concrete example of a successful one-tweak?**

A: I might try to repackage my offer into a firm fixed price productized service. I bill some portion up front. I saw this with a recruiting agency for global talent - they would spend a little time talking with the client up front and a lot of them would ghost. So they required a $500 deposit which would be put toward the placement to go to the second conversation. Worked really well.

**Q: How do you handle existing customers when implementing a tweak?**

A: I test the new approach with new customers. If it goes well then I roll it out to existing customers over time.

**Q: What are the most common business model cruxes at different revenue stages?**

A: After $1M the owner needs to look hard at pricing. Until then it's just sell whatever to get cash flow going. After that threshold they should start price discriminating. Looking at ways to go to fixed prices so they can gain efficiency. Maybe look at good, better, best pricing.

**Q: What's the biggest mistake with good/better/best pricing?**

A: The goal is to make the middle offer the real one you want to sell. Make sure it has good characteristics for you. I also see this with trying to get more money upfront - you offer a discount off the price if you pay for longer and up front. Another business model tweak as owners grow is to watch customer dependency. You need to work to diversify your customer base.

**Q: What's your threshold for customer concentration risk?**

A: Anything over 10% is a flag but once it's at 20-25% you need to have a plan.

**Q: What delivery model changes are most impactful for scaling?**

A: It's all of those things working together. Look across your best and most profitable customers. What is similar about them and what is similar about what you provide them. Try to productize that. Another great exercise for innovation is thinking about what problems everyone in your industry faces. If all your competitors have the same problem, if you can apply technology to that and figure out how to improve it, you've now unlocked huge value.

**Q: When do you need a major overhaul versus tweaks?**

A: Watch gross margin and cash. If these are declining systematically you have issues and need to pivot your model.

### Key Insights:
- One tweak at a time, linked to strategic crux
- Test with new customers first
- $1M threshold for pricing optimization
- Customer concentration: 10% warning, 20-25% danger
- Industry-wide problems = huge opportunities
- Declining gross margin and cash = pivot signal

### The ONE Thing:
Keep making small changes one at a time. Test with new customers. If gross margin and cash are declining systematically, then pivot.
