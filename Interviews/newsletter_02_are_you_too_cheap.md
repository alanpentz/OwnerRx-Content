## The Problem

"I know I need someone better but that's expensive. It's easier to do it myself."

Sound familiar? You're choking your business to death with your scarcity mindset.

## The Real Cost of Being Cheap

When you avoid a $500 expense, you might be missing out on $500,000 in potential revenue. But you can't see that because you're too busy saving pennies while dollars fly out the window.

This isn't about being financially irresponsible. It's about understanding the difference between an expense and an investment.

## Why We're Wired This Way

Your childhood experiences about money are running your business decisions:
- "Money doesn't grow on trees"
- "We can't afford that"
- "Do it yourself and save money"

These mantras kept your family safe. Now they're keeping your business small.

## The Action Plan

### Week 1: Track Your Time
Document every hour spent on low-value tasks. Be honest about what your time is worth.

### Week 2: Make One Hire
Find someone to handle your most time-consuming, low-value task. Start small - even 5 hours a week.

### Week 3: Set Up Check-ins
Weekly 15-minute evaluations. Is this working? What's the ROI?

### Month 3: Ruthless Assessment
Did this hire save you more time than it cost? If yes, what's next? If no, what did you learn?

## The Growth Fund Strategy

Create a "Growth Fund" - 1-3% of monthly revenue exclusively for delegation experiments.

Rules:
- It's not permanent - think 3-month pilots
- Track everything - time saved, revenue generated
- Kill what doesn't work quickly
- Double down on what does

## The Mental Shift

Stop treating every hire like a lifetime commitment. Treat it like dating:
- Start casual
- See if there's chemistry
- Escalate if it works
- Move on if it doesn't

## Focus Areas for Maximum Impact

Delegate tasks that:
1. Take you 10+ hours per week
2. Someone else can do 80% as well
3. Don't require your unique expertise
4. Prevent you from high-value activities

## The Bottom Line

The business owners making real money aren't the ones hoarding every penny. They're the ones who figured out that the right $500 investment can generate $5,000 in value.

Stop being so cheap that you can't afford to grow.
