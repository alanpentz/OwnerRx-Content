## Interview Opening

You've written about the exit paradox - owners who say they want to sell but never actually prepare for it, and those who build to sell end up never wanting to leave. Let's explore your unfiltered views on exit planning and what actually matters when it's time to get out.

## Key Insights Captured

### 1. The 80% Reality Check

**Alan's Brutal Truth:**
"Something like 80% of businesses never sell. They are just their owner and there's nothing else there."

**The Better Strategy:**
"Most owners should focus on taking money out of their business regularly to diversify their investments outside."

**The 3-5x Math:**
"A few will sell for 3-5x and that's great but the reality is you could have run the business for 3-5 years, made the money and still owned the asset."

**The Real Exit Strategy:**
"That's why you should focus on aligning the business to what you love and life you want. Keep it."

**The Optimization Path:**
"You can also work to optimize it. Build the process and hire better people. Build a real leadership team and then you can stop working in the business day to day and still harvest the cash flow."

**Key Insight:** Stop planning to sell. Plan to keep it, optimize it, and harvest cash flow forever.

## Current Interview Progress

### 2. The Four D's of Real Sales

**Alan's Buyer Perspective:**
"Main St businesses usually sell because of death, divorce, disability, or retirement."

**The Red Flag:**
"I don't take a services based business with a 40 year old owner seriously when it wants to sell. That's a red flag."

**The Smart Acquisition Strategy:**
"Only spend time looking at acquisitions with old owners. Dead ones are even better."

**What This Reveals:**
- Young owners selling = business problems
- Old owners selling = legitimate exit
- Death/disability = motivated sellers
- Best deals come from necessity, not choice

**Key Insight:** Real businesses sell for real reasons (the 4 D's), not because someone got bored.

### 3. The 1% Strategy vs Reality

**Alan's Distinction:**
"Building to sell is a 1% strategy. A few ideas are big and unique enough that they'll scale quickly. Don't take money out of those. It's much better off inside growing at 20x."

**The PE Path:**
"There's also a private equity M&A roll up strategy. That's great too but you're working for investors then."

**The Optimization Paradox:**
"Most businesses won't sell for that much. Of course optimize it for sale. That's good because sellable businesses are good to run but once it's there why would you sell it?"

**The Market Exception:**
"Of course markets go wild and something can get hot. If someone is going to pay you 10x earnings versus 5x, I'd think about it."

**The Strategy:**
- Build as if to sell (creates good business)
- But plan to keep (harvest cash flow)
- Unless market goes crazy (take 10x)
- Or you're the 1% unicorn (keep reinvesting)

**Key Insight:** Build it sellable but keep it. Sellable businesses are just well-run businesses you'd want to own forever.

### 4. The Size and Team Solution

**Alan's Size Reality:**
"There's a size issue here. The business needs to be big enough to afford a team to run it that isn't the owner. That's tough to do in a $1M business but very doable at $10M."

**The Process First Approach:**
"I recommend the owner work to build out all the processes so the company is optimized and able to report progress and catch issues."

**The Team Not Person Strategy:**
"Then put a team in place to run it, not just one person. That one person becomes a big dependency factor for the owner if there isn't some redundant leadership in place."

**The Path:**
1. Grow to sufficient size ($10M easier than $1M)
2. Build processes that report and catch issues
3. Install a TEAM not a single leader
4. Create redundant leadership (no single points of failure)

**Key Insight:** You can't extract yourself from a $1M business. Grow it to $10M, then build a leadership team, not a single replacement.

## The ONE Thing (Alan's Final Answer)

**If you only do one thing:**
"Get out of the key functions of the business. Build the systems and team to run without you."

**Why This Matters:**
- Creates optionality (sell or keep)
- Increases valuation immediately
- Gives you your life back
- Makes the business an asset, not a job
- Works whether you sell or harvest cash

**The Bottom Line:** A business that needs you isn't a business - it's a job with extra stress.
