### Topic: Compensation & Incentives

**Q: What's your overall philosophy on compensation?**

A: If you can use global talent, pay market rate there and then pay above market for your key positions domestically so you can get and keep the best people.

**Q: What about base versus variable compensation?**

A: Sales always wants commissions so just live with it. I prefer to just pay salary but incentive compensation is always something people want. I try to keep it low and link it to some performance metric. People will game any incentive system so the only thing you can do is to just keep changing it.

**Q: Can you give an example of gaming?**

A: If you pay for profit, they'll bring in smaller deals. If you pay for revenue they'll bring in less profit, etc. In the end I settled on gross margin for deals or at least projected gross margin. But it gets complicated quick. Just come up with a system and keep it for a year. Within 2-3 years you'll need to change it. You'll notice some flaw in it. Maybe as you grew another metric became more important or people figured out how to get more gross margin from the same customers but now you have customer concentration so you need to incentivize for new logos, etc.

**Q: What about equity compensation?**

A: For regular main street business almost no one should get equity. As you grow you might develop a deferred incentive plan for top leaders. Try to keep any equity phantom. Give people a reward for growing the company but make it something you can get out of. Try to never give away real equity. If you are in a profitable cash flowing business people have an incentive to convert their stock options. This doesn't happen for venture funded. There won't be dividends there.

**Q: How do you handle compensation negotiations?**

A: I try to keep lower level employees in strict bands. For senior managers I try to develop long term plans so we aren't always negotiating but the market is the market. If pay goes up, you have to update the deals.

**Q: What about raises?**

A: I don't have one rule on this. But I force real conversations about who is performing and who isn't. Don't give any raise to people in the lower half of performance. Save the money for the best performers. Most people have trouble doing that so they do a blend and give people bigger bumps at promotion times.

**Q: What about non-monetary compensation?**

A: I like to give a bit more time off than others. I don't think people really value much else. If you skew older people will care about health care and retirement but younger people just want more money and more time off.

**Q: What about creative compensation when cash-constrained?**

A: That is tough. Most employees won't take terms. They aren't entrepreneurs. You can try outcome bonuses but I don't think it'll be that successful.

**Q: How do you handle role changes?**

A: That's just a market adjust. Look at salary surveys and open positions on the market and adjust to that.

**Q: What's the biggest compensation mistake?**

A: Don't give away equity.
