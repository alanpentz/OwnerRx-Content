### Topic: Culture & Engagement

**Q: What's your view on company culture?**

A: Getting results is a culture. I think it's essential. The culture is a reflection of the owner. You need to look at yourself in the mirror and realize this. It starts with values. I do an exercise where we go through all our best people and say why they are good. Do the same with the lowest performers. What words come out? Those are your values. It's the behaviors you hire, fire, and promote for.

**Q: What if the owner's culture is holding the company back?**

A: They need to start working on themselves. The company will only grow as fast as the owner can. This is the best and worst thing about owning a business. It's all about you.

**Q: What about culture building activities?**

A: Committees are useless. The owner defines the culture. Retreats are fun and people do bond on them. The leadership team needs to do these and to define long term strategy. Whole company retreats are for fun, not for real work.

**Q: How do you handle cultural fit in hiring?**

A: I 100% screen for it. Use personality tests as well. They aren't perfect but it's what you've got.

**Q: What about remote work culture?**

A: You need to adjust expectations. It isn't the same thing. We've done at least one yearly all hands in person but it's expensive and a ton of work. This is a tough issue.

**Q: What about engagement surveys?**

A: Do all those things.

**Q: How do you handle toxic high performers?**

A: You have to fire them. The brilliant jerk can't stay.

**Q: What about transparency?**

A: Employees need to know the vision and enough to do their jobs. I'm not a fan of open book culture. It can work if you spend a lot of time training employees but without that it creates chaos. I say avoid it.

**Q: How do you maintain culture through rapid growth?**

A: Owner communication is the best way but there's not a lot you can do beyond that. No one has time. The reality is you'll spend a year or so weeding out the bad apples from rapid growth. Build all your hiring and other systems to minimize it but standards get lowered during rapid growth. It's inevitable.

**Q: What's the one thing for culture?**

A: Defining what they want the culture to be based on who they are. Some owners resist the idea that they are the center of the company but they are. If other people were they'd own the company. There's no right culture, there's just a right culture for the owner.
