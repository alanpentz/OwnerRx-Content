**Interviewer:** Interview Agent
**Subject:** Alan Pentz

## The Belief Gap

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** What's the biggest lie or misconception about translating vision to daily practice that even smart owners believe?

**ALAN:** They don't believe they can make it happen. Visions are for offsites and then you get back to the real world and they seem like pipe dreams.

**Key Insight:** The vision dies from disbelief, not poor execution. Offsites create fantasies, Monday kills them. If you don't believe it's possible, it isn't.

## Vision That Drives Action

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** How do you make a vision real enough that people actually use it to make daily decisions?

**ALAN:** First is linking it to what gives the owner energy. If you can show the owner that this drives growth, it helps them prioritize it.

**The Energy-Growth Connection:**
- Vision must energize the owner
- Connect vision to growth metrics
- Energy + growth = priority
- Dead vision = one that doesn't excite
- Growth link makes it business-critical

## Making Vision Memorable

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Most companies have vision statements but employees can't recite them. How do you make vision stick in people's minds?

**ALAN:** Keep it simple and short and say it all the time.

**The Simplicity Formula:**
- Short enough to remember
- Simple enough to understand
- Repeated until embedded
- Not paragraphs of corporate speak
- A phrase, not a page

## The Monthly Bridge

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** The gap between annual vision and daily tasks is huge. What's the bridge that actually connects them?

**ALAN:** Regular practice and check-ins. You need to look at progress at least monthly and recommit.

**The Connection Cadence:**
- Annual vision alone = death
- Monthly progress review
- Monthly recommitment
- Regular practice creates habit
- The gap is too big without touchpoints

## The Daily Question

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Last question - what's the one practice that makes vision actually influence daily work instead of being wall art?

**ALAN:** Daily prioritization and ask yourself why am I working on this other stuff.

**The Daily Challenge:**
- Every day: "Why am I doing this?"
- If not vision-aligned, stop
- Daily prioritization against vision
- The question that kills busy work

## The ONE Thing

If an owner only does ONE thing about vision to daily practice, what should it be?

**Make your vision short and energizing. Check progress monthly. Ask daily: "Why am I working on this instead of the vision?" Stop what doesn't align.**
