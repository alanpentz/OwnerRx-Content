### Topic: Strategic Partnerships

**Q: What's your philosophy on strategic partnerships?**

A: I approach them cautiously. Anything with the word strategic in front of it makes me think I'm going to waste time or lose money.

**Q: What makes partnerships successful?**

A: It's all about aligned incentives, a clearly scoped agreement with a way out for everyone involved, and constant communication.

**Q: Can you give an example of a partnership structure that works?**

A: We do this in government contracting a lot. Because of contract vehicles and sometimes capabilities you need to partner to win deals. We do a lot of negotiating up front and create clear swim lanes. After we start working together there are regular partner meetings to ensure the health of the relationship.

**Q: What about referral partnerships?**

A: They usually don't work out. It's fine when two companies have similar clients but very distinct services. Like if I do podcast production and the client wants google ads, I can refer them. But if there is overlap it's messy.

**Q: What are the red flags in partnerships?**

A: What is the partner really committing to? How much time and money do I have to invest to make this work and produce actual revenue? Are there better ways to spend my resources?

**Q: What about technology/platform partnerships?**

A: Platforms are powerful and we should definitely use them but we must realize that the more powerful partner will pull the rug out from under you eventually. Facebook did it. Google did it, etc. Have a plan to grow on their platform but be diversifying to owned channels and mechanisms as you go.

**Q: What about equity partnerships or joint ventures?**

A: This is scary to me. I don't like long term commitments like this. If it's an investment fine. The other party is running the business but I'm taking a stake. Evaluate that like any investment but if I'm operating in this new entity, do I have a boss or a partner that can prevent me from doing things. I hate that. Sometimes you might have to do it but then I want control if at all possible.

**Q: How do you handle inbound partnership requests?**

A: I ignore it unless they have something very specific to talk about.

**Q: What about distribution partnerships?**

A: Have a lot of partners if possible. Big distribution partners are demanding. They can fuel growth but they can kill your margin and turn around and white label your product. You are riding the dragon and it's always possible it will eat you. You have to have alternatives. Take the cash you get from them and build somewhere else assuming it won't last.

**Q: What's the one thing about partnerships?**

A: If you need them, do a lot of research, answer all your questions up front. Don't leave anything vague. If you can get by without them, focus on your own shit. It's a distraction.
