**You Will Be Superhuman**

** How I’m Going to Help**

May 07, 2025   |   Read Online

We've all heard the AI hype machine.

"Everyone in x industry will be unemployed in 6 months!"

"Our whole world will change!"

Like most business owners, I rolled my eyes. But as an early adopter, I still explored AI tools despite their limitations. The major language models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) were useful but not revolutionary. I wrote job descriptions, tuned my writing, and searched more efficiently - helpful, but hardly transformative.

Earlier this year, particularly in April, something shifted dramatically. OpenAI released their advanced o3 model through the ChatGPT Pro plan ($200/month).

Then suddenly…everything clicked.

Within days, my workflow completely transformed.

This wasn’t just a better chatbot. It remembered my business, adapted to my goals, and quickly became the backbone of my daily workflow. I was writing, planning, analyzing, even coaching — all in ChatGPT.

Moving my work back to traditional tools like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace felt like trading a scalpel for a rusty butterknife.

I wondered: How long until these traditional productivity suites become obsolete? Months? A year?

I’ll just organize and share everything right inside the Chatbot.

I wasn't just working faster - I was accomplishing things previously impossible for a small business owner without a team of specialists.

Here's one real-world example that demonstrated the power:

After a few sales calls, I asked ChatGPT to analyze best practices. It delivered a report that would rival a pro consultant — in three minutes.

Then I built a custom GPT to:

**Score** my sales calls

**Generate **better scripts

**Draft** follow-up emails

One founder. The power of an entire sales department.

I quickly realized I could apply this approach to every area of business:

**Management & Leadership:**

- Team Meeting Evaluator that analyzes discussions against high-performing team research

- Coaching Effectiveness Analyzer that improves how I coach business owners

- Direct Report Evaluator that helps CEOs track accountability and performance

**Marketing & Sales:**

- Marketing Strategy Developer

- Ideal Customer Profile Builder

- Google Ads Performance Optimizer

**Strategy & Planning:**

-Strategic Planning Assistant

- Operations Optimizer that identifies process improvements

- Financial Analysis Assistant

- Team Performance Tracker

To be transparent, there are still constraints. These tools can't yet independently execute tasks - I still copy-paste those follow-up emails into Gmail. The “agent” vision of the future where AI performs all the tasks for you is still that. A vision. And while AI can design beautiful landing pages, getting them working in IRL platforms is still a pain.

As you can tell by using those AI features slapped into most software, it’s going to take some time to reach that vision.

When ChatGPT’s capabilities are aligned with what you are doing feels like walking on a wide open airport moving walkway - everything is faster and easier inside the AI environment, but stepping back into regular tools feels like being trapped behind a family of tourists with 3 carry-ons a piece.

But I can see what's coming. I can almost taste it. Within months or a just a year or two, you’ll be able to go from idea to fully scalable application in minutes.

You have a great marketing solution?

Now you can serve millions of businesses at once. If you previously charged $3-10k a month in a retainer, now you might charge $50 and make 10-100x more money.

At that point, I think you are superhuman. You’ve completely broken down all the friction and constraints that normally keep us boxed in.

Even without those advances, I'm already certain I can out-compete my six-month-ago self using just the tools I've developed so far.

As a business owner, you can and need to do the same or that guy charging $50 isn’t going to be you, it’ll be your competitor.

**I’m sharing the full story—and all the templates—during a live, free, and no-fluff webinar on May 19th.**

🎯** Who it’s for:** Owners, founders, and solo execs who need *results*—not tech demos.

💸** Cost:** Free (recording included)

🎁 **What you’ll get:**

**How to build and use a GPT **in ChatGPT. It’s about as easy as it gets. I promise.

**Live teardown of a Sales-Call Analyzer GPT** that grades real transcripts, writes follow-ups, and improves your close rate—no dev skills required.

**Blueprints for where else you can use GPTs and AI to 10-100x your productivity**.

A sneak peek at the **4-Week AI Business Sprint** I’m planning to help owners who want to ride the wave rather than get swamped by it (yep, attendees get first dibs and a bonus).

By the end, you’ll know exactly how to out-perform the version of yourself from the day before the webinar—using tools that cost less than your monthly coffee habit.
