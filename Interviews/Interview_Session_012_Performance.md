## Interview Opening

Performance reviews, PIPs, "coaching conversations" - most of it's corporate theater that wastes everyone's time. Meanwhile, owners either avoid difficult conversations entirely or explode when someone screws up for the tenth time. Let's talk about what actually works for managing performance in a small business.

## Key Insights Captured

### 1. The Universal Truth Nobody Admits

**Alan's Reality:**
"No one wants to do performance management but everyone needs it. It is almost like pulling teeth to get the process done but if you don't it's even worse."

**The Paradox:** Everyone hates it, everyone needs it, skipping it makes everything worse.

## Current Interview Progress

### 2. The AI-Powered Weekly System

**Alan's Modern Approach:**
"I think the best thing is to have a check in meeting with every direct report once a week or at minimum once every two weeks. Record the meetings and get a transcript."

**The AI Analysis:**
"You can build a GPT in ChatGPT or just cut and paste the transcript into an LLM have it extract action items, areas where accountability is unclear, clear expectations, and an agenda for your next week."

**The Long-Term Power:**
"Over time you can put them all in a folder and have the LLM look across them for trends and blind spots and it can even generate the review."

**The Complete System:**
1. Weekly/biweekly 1-on-1s (recorded)
2. AI extracts action items and accountability gaps
3. AI generates next week's agenda
4. AI spots patterns over time
5. AI writes the performance review

**Key Insight:** Stop writing notes. Record everything, let AI track performance patterns and write your reviews.

### 3. The Accountability Reality

**Alan's Framework:**
"I like to use the outcomes and outputs framework. It forces me to be clearer about what I want."

**The Core Problem:**
"At the root of the issue a lot of times is that the employee can't perform the job. The manager knows it but doesn't want to have to give people tough feedback. It's hard to get them to do it."

**The AI Truth Mirror:**
"That's why I like using LLMs. They will make you look at what's happening."

**What AI Forces You to See:**
- Employee can't actually do the job
- Manager avoiding tough conversations
- Expectations were never clear
- Pattern of excuses over time
- Performance gaps you're ignoring

**Key Insight:** Managers know who's failing but won't say it. AI transcripts don't let you hide from the truth.

### 4. The Growth Ceiling Truth

**Alan's Trade-off:**
"It's all about trading off short term pain for long term pain."

**The Growth Killer:**
"The number one reason companies don't grow is because the owner is allowing blockers to stay in key roles."

**The Brutal Math:**
"I say that every time a company doubles or triples 50% of the leadership team needs to turn over. People just can't grow as fast as the company they are managing."

**The Emotional Trap:**
"Owners don't want to face this. Often these people have been with them for a while. Back in the chaotic days but now they can't adapt to the new more professional days."

**The Pattern:**
- Loyal early employee becomes bottleneck
- Can't scale from chaos to systems
- Owner feels guilty about loyalty
- Company growth stalls at their competence level

**Key Insight:** Your early heroes become your growth blockers. 50% leadership turnover per doubling is normal, not cruel.

## The ONE Thing (Alan's Final Answer)

**If you only do one thing:**
"Realize that their growth is most likely being held back by some blockers in their organization."

**The Time Reality:**
"They need to face up to the reality that most people can't change and if they can't it's not in a timeframe that works for the company."

**The Ultimate Choice:**
"Do you want Sally to keep this job or do you want to reach your revenue goals? Your choice."

**Why This Matters:**
- You already know who the blockers are
- They're not going to suddenly improve
- Every day you wait costs growth
- Loyalty to underperformers is disloyalty to the business
- Your revenue goals require different people

**The Bottom Line:** Stop pretending people will change. Choose between keeping them or growing.
