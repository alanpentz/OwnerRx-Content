While You're On Version 3, Your Competition Is On Version 3,000

AI isn't just for automation; the real power is in simulation

Everyone's using AI to automate stuff. Writing blogs, analyzing data, scheduling meetings.

And that’s great. I do it and encourage you to do it as well.

But the smartest operators I know? They're using AI for something completely different.

**They're using it to simulate.**

Let me show you what I mean.

Take that proposal you're working on for your biggest client. You've rewritten it twice. Had your team review it. Maybe even slept on it.

Know what you could do instead?

Have AI simulate how your client will react. Not just one way - but from 10 different angles:

The CFO who only cares about ROI

The operations manager worried about implementation

The end user who has to actually use your solution

The CEO who wants the 30,000-foot view

The skeptic who's been burned before

**Or that new ad campaign you're launching.**

Instead of A/B testing with real money and real time, simulate responses from:

Price-conscious buyers vs premium buyers

Technical buyers vs relationship buyers

Industry veterans vs newcomers

Different company sizes and verticals

By the time you go live, you've already tested 1,000 variations in your head.

Nate’s Substack just did a great post on this that really helped me clarify my thinking. I realized I was already doing this. I just hadn’t labelled it.

Remember that Board of Titans GPT I showed you? Where you get feedback from Bezos on customer obsession, Musk on first principles, Buffett on competitive moats?

Same. Exact. Principle.

It's simulation on steroids. Instead of one perspective, you get six.

**Here's the bottom line:**

Automation makes you efficient. Simulation makes you unstoppable.

One saves you time. The other saves you from mistakes you haven't made yet.

One helps you do things faster. The other helps you do the right things.

Your competition is still spell-checking their first draft. You could be perfecting your thousandth.

Question is: Which side of that gap do you want to be on?

P.S. Next week, I'll write about how to start implementing this. Warning: Once you start thinking this way, you can't go back. But why would you want to?
