## The Vendor Upgrade Cycle

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** What's the biggest lie or misconception about vendor management that even smart owners believe?

**ALAN:** Vendors need to be upgraded as you go just like employees. Review them annually.

**Key Insight:** Set and forget = death. Your business evolves, vendors must too. Annual vendor reviews like employee reviews.

---

## The Win-Win Relationship

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Most owners either squeeze vendors for every penny or get taken advantage of. What's the right relationship to have with key suppliers?

**ALAN:** Try to make it a win-win. I want my suppliers to make money too so they are healthy but if they want to charge me more, I want more value.

**The Balanced Approach:**
- Want profitable, stable suppliers
- Not charity, not exploitation
- Price increases = value increases
- Healthy suppliers = reliable supply
- Dead suppliers = your problem

---

## The Plus-One Strategy

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Supply chain concentration - one supplier vs many. Most owners don't think about this until it's too late. What's the right balance?

**ALAN:** It's expensive and time consuming to find alternative suppliers depending on the product or service. With the current geopolitical environment and in general try to have a plus-one strategy. A key supplier plus one alternate.

**The Plus-One Formula:**
- Primary supplier for efficiency
- Backup supplier for safety
- Not 10 (chaos and complexity)
- Not 1 (single point of failure)
- Geopolitical reality demands backups

## Build vs Buy Decision Matrix

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** When should an owner bring something in-house vs outsource to vendors? Everyone has a different philosophy here.

**ALAN:** It's very dependent. You need to do a buy vs build analysis. For things that are critical to your revenue stream be more willing to insource but don't build your own HR software unless it powers your business somehow.

**The Decision Framework:**
- **Revenue critical:** Consider building
- **Support function:** Always buy
- **Unique advantage:** Maybe build
- **Commodity:** Never build
- **Example:** Don't build HR software (ego project)

## The Fatal Vendor Mistake

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Last question - what's the vendor management mistake that costs small businesses the most money?

**ALAN:** Over-reliance on a revenue critical vendor with no alternate.

**The Death Scenario:**
- Single vendor for revenue-critical input
- No backup identified
- Vendor fails/raises prices/gets bought
- Business held hostage or dies

## The ONE Thing

If an owner only does ONE thing about vendor management, what should it be?

**Implement plus-one strategy for any revenue-critical vendor. One primary, one backup. Review all vendors annually like employees.**

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Annual vendor reviews** - Upgrade vendors like employees
2. **Win-win relationships** - Want healthy suppliers, not dying ones
3. **Plus-one strategy** - Primary + backup for critical supplies
4. **Build vs buy clarity** - Revenue critical maybe, support never
5. **Geopolitical reality** - Current environment demands backups
6. **Fatal mistake** - Single critical vendor with no alternate
7. **Value for price** - Increases must bring value
