## Interview Opening

You've been brutally honest about how most small business owners handle their numbers - they don't. Books are months behind, they're flying blind, making decisions based on gut feel rather than data. Let's dig into what financial metrics actually matter and how owners should track them.

## Key Insights Captured

### 1. The Labor Efficiency Blind Spot

**Alan's Critical Metric:**
"Labor is everyone's biggest cost and they need to measure it."

**The Crabtree Framework:**
"I use Greg Crabtree's Labor Efficiency Ratio which is revenue divided by total labor cost."

**The Decomposition:**
- **Direct LER:** "Revenue/direct labor spend (people who work directly for or on a customer)"
- **Management LER:** "Take revenue minus direct labor spend and divide that total by management and admin labor spend to get management labor efficiency"

**Why This Matters:**
"These give you goal posts to measure your biggest investment: labor"

**Key Insight:** Most owners track revenue and profit but miss the efficiency of their biggest expense - people.

### 2. The LER Benchmarks

**Alan's Profitability Standard:**
"For a profitable business where the owner is paying himself a market wage you get a 2 overall labor efficiency."

**The Flexibility Reality:**
"Once you decompose that it is company by company. You can have more in management and less in direct or vice versa. That's just a business choice."

**The Industry Exception:**
"Of course there are highly profitable businesses like SaaS software where it'll be higher than a 2.0"

**What This Means:**
- LER of 2.0 = For every $1 in labor, you generate $2 in revenue
- Below 2.0 = You're probably not profitable after owner comp
- The mix between direct and management is strategic choice
- SaaS and tech can hit 3.0+ due to leverage

**Key Insight:** Most owners discover they're at 1.5 or lower - they're basically a nonprofit paying themselves poorly.

### 3. The Real-World Dashboard

**Alan's Weekly Check:**
"Weekly is just sales and cash. Everything else is monthly."

**The Monthly Five:**
"On a monthly basis you should look at revenue, gross margin, labor efficiency, profit, and cash."

**The Trend Alert:**
"I also look for any numbers that are moving up or down a lot."

**The Practical Dashboard:**
- **Weekly (2 numbers):** Sales, Cash
- **Monthly (5 numbers):** Revenue, Gross Margin, Labor Efficiency, Profit, Cash
- **Watch for:** Any metric moving >10% month-over-month

**Key Insight:** Stop drowning in metrics. Two numbers weekly, five monthly, and watch for big moves.

### 4. The Bookkeeper Solution

**Alan's Direct Answer:**
"Hire a better bookkeeper is the goal."

**The AI Future (Not Yet):**
"Soon AI will do this for us. Some of the early solutions look promising but we aren't there yet."

**The Global Talent Play:**
"This is also a good place to go for global talent."

**The Practical Path:**
- Fire the bad bookkeeper (or yourself)
- Hire globally for 1/3 the cost
- Get monthly books within 5 days of month-end
- Wait for AI to fully automate (coming soon)

**Key Insight:** Stop accepting late books. Global talent can do it better, faster, cheaper - today.

## The ONE Thing (Alan's Final Answer)

**If you only track one number:**
"Cash."

**Why This Matters:**
- Cash is truth
- Revenue is vanity
- Profit is theory
- Cash is survival
- No cash = no business

**The Bottom Line:** Everything else is commentary. Watch your cash.
