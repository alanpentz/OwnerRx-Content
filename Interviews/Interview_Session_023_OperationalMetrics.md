### Topic: Operational Metrics & KPIs

**Q: How many operational metrics to track?**

A: A vital few. Something leading and lagging. A customer sat score, a volume based score, etc.

**Q: What's THE operational metric?**

A: It's usually customer satisfaction or throughput.

**Q: What leading indicators are actually predictive?**

A: You want some leading measure of throughput utilization, on time delivery, etc. Is the system producing at a sufficient rate?

**Q: How do you diagnose when metrics go south?**

A: Find the bottleneck and do root cause analysis. If there's one or two readings that are within a range, I don't respond. There's random variation but a pattern is when you get 4 in a row going down or a few readings going down a lot. I use "Understanding Variation: The Key to Managing Chaos" as a guide.

**Q: What about benchmarking?**

A: Very important.

**Q: How do you prevent gaming of metrics?**

A: Don't attach incentives to the measures. There are other measures like revenue goals that you can attach incentives to.

**Q: Real-time versus periodic measurement?**

A: Very little is real time outside of some manufacturing and tech processes. It's all dependent on the cost vs value of getting the information.

**Q: What breaks first when scaling?**

A: Utilization can spike. Quality measures fall. Then customer sat falls.

**Q: What about productivity metrics for knowledge work?**

A: I like to use them as KPIs but not attach incentives to them. Maybe to utilization in an hourly time and materials business but not in general.

**Q: What are the 3-5 universal metrics?**

A: Track a throughput measure and an outcome measure like customer sat.

### Key Insights:
- Vital few over comprehensive dashboards
- Two essential: throughput (volume) and outcome (satisfaction)
- Watch for patterns: 4 in a row declining or big drops
- Don't incentivize operational metrics - use revenue instead
- The failure cascade: utilization spikes → quality falls → satisfaction crashes

### The ONE Thing:
Track a throughput measure and an outcome measure - that's it.
