It’s all about people

You know what I learned after watching dozens of small business owners blame everything except the obvious?

The bottleneck isn't your systems. It's not your software. It's not "the economy" or "AI disruption" or whatever excuse is trending on Twitter this week.

**The bottleneck is sitting at a desk, probably checking their phone right now instead of doing the work that actually moves the needle.**

Here's some uncomfortable truth: When growth stalls, small business owners immediately start playing whack-a-mole with tactics. "We need better software!" "The market has changed!" "We need new systems!"

Nine times out of ten, you've got a people problem disguised as a process problem. That key person you hired 18 months ago? The one who built their little kingdom but hasn't improved a single metric since they got comfortable? They're your real bottleneck.

**Here's the brutal question that'll save you months of spinning your wheels: Would you enthusiastically re-hire your key team member today?**

Not "are they nice" or "do they show up on time." Would you bet your next six months of revenue on their ability to move the needle?

If you hesitated even for a second, you already know the answer.

Look, I get it. Change is scary. Your current person probably has "relationships" and "knows how we do things" and makes detailed reports that say absolutely nothing about results.

But here's what matters in 2025: Can they adapt faster than your competition?

Every industry changes every quarter now. AI is rewriting job descriptions monthly. Best practices shift like sand. The person guarding your playbook better be treating it like a living document, not scripture carved in stone.

**You need results-driven, improvement-minded talent.** People who get excited about outcomes, not just activities. People who'd rather test new approaches than defend old ones for three hours.

Stop throwing money at new tools and start asking harder questions about the person using them:

When's the last time they suggested an improvement you hadn't thought of?

Do they talk about results or activities when reporting progress?

Are they learning new skills or coasting on old ones?

Would they survive at a high-growth company for six months?

Define your non-negotiables: measurable outcomes per month (give them a number), process improvements (make it trackable), and speed of execution (how fast can they implement and iterate?).

Here's the part that makes traditional employees sweat: The world got smaller. That operations expert in Eastern Europe costs half what your local "we've always done it this way" person charges. That process optimizer in South America runs circles around your current team's execution speed.

I'm not saying fire everyone and go remote. I'm saying expand your talent pool beyond your zip code. The best business operators aren't necessarily in your city—they're wherever hunger meets skill.

Time for some uncomfortable honesty. Look at your business results from the last six months. Really look. Are you getting the growth that matches your investment in people and systems?

If not, the problem isn't your tools. It's not your market. It's not your industry.

**It's the person between your strategy and your results.**

Start scouting. Start asking around. Start building a pipeline of people who'd be thrilled to prove they can outperform your current setup.

Because while you're debating whether to give your current key person "one more quarter," your competition is already hiring the person who's going to eat your lunch.
