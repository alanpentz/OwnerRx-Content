## Interview Opening

You've been ahead of the curve on AI and automation - telling owners to use AI before hiring, automating before delegating. But most owners are either paralyzed by tech choices or throwing money at solutions that don't solve real problems. Let's dig into what actually works.

## Key Insights Captured

### 1. The Adoption Failure

**Alan's Core Problem:**
"Mostly they have no plan to adopt the software. They might be excited by it but no one on the team is."

**The Team Size Trap:**
"The bigger the team gets, the worse this is."

**The Audit Solution:**
"Regularly audit use of software and cancel low usage ones."

**The Owner-First Approach:**
"Then play with new software yourself as an owner and develop a plan for integrating it."

**The Competitive Reality:**
"This is hard stuff. A company's ability to rapidly adopt new tech is a key lever for success but it is really hard to get done."

**Key Insight:** Tech fails because there's no adoption plan. Owner excitement doesn't equal team usage.

## Current Interview Progress

### 2. AI as Thinking Partner

**Alan's Core Use Case:**
"It should be your key thinking partner as an owner. Almost all owners who aren't doing physical tasks should be in it every day."

**The Practical Applications:**
"It can write proposals, analyze customer info. Give you the best answer for almost any question."

**What This Means:**
- Daily use is non-negotiable
- It's your strategic advisor
- Proposal writing automated
- Customer analysis instant
- Answer any business question

**Key Insight:** AI isn't a tool, it's your thinking partner. If you're not using it daily, you're operating with half a brain.

### 3. The Smart Automation Sequence

**Alan's Starting Point:**
"I'd start with simple things that can be done with GPTs. There's not a lot of workflow there."

**Easy Content Wins:**
"You can take a podcast transcript or an interview you did and run it through a GPT to create blog posts or social content."

**Customer Intelligence:**
"You can do the same thing with customer conversations to get follow up steps, action and places where you might have missed an opportunity to upsell."

**The Department Approach:**
"Then when you are ready start with an overworked department of the business that has lots of repetitive tasks. I often find HR is like this."

**Specific HR Examples:**
"You can build an automation that passes a new hire to the onboarding workflow with a Zap or connects to ChatGPT to analyze resumes for fit, etc."

**The Progression:**
1. Start with GPTs (no workflow complexity)
2. Content creation from existing assets
3. Customer conversation analysis
4. Target overworked departments
5. HR often the best starting point

**Key Insight:** Start with standalone GPTs before complex workflows. Target the most overworked department first.

### 4. The 30-Day Implementation

**Alan's Leadership Approach:**
"I think the owner starts by showing the team."

**Week 1 - Simple GPTs:**
"The easiest stuff is simple GPTs. Do some searching about how to prompt well and create simple GPTs to generate content or answer certain kinds of questions."

**Week 2-3 - Claude Connectors:**
"Other low hanging fruit is using Claude and its connectors."

**Specific Claude Applications:**
- "You can do sentiment analysis on your Slack channels"
- "Find out which team has the most active usage and why"
- "Have Claude read your email conversations with a customer over time and find trends and opportunities to improve the relationship"

**The 30-Day Plan:**
1. Owner demonstrates to team
2. Learn basic prompting
3. Build simple GPTs for content
4. Connect Claude to existing tools
5. Analyze team communication
6. Mine customer emails for insights

**Key Insight:** Owner must lead by example. Start with analysis of existing data (Slack, email) before building new workflows.

## The ONE Thing (Alan's Final Answer)

**If you only do one thing:**
"Sign up for Claude and connect it to your email, calendar, and whatever else you use if you are on Google products."

**The Alternative (Non-Google):**
"If not, build a GPT in ChatGPT that analyzes your sales calls and gives you tips on what to improve."

**Why This Works:**
- Immediate insights from existing data
- Zero workflow complexity
- Instant ROI on conversations
- Catches missed opportunities
- Improves sales performance today

**The Bottom Line:** Connect AI to your existing tools TODAY. Start mining the gold in your email and calendar.
