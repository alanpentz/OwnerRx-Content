## Key Insights Captured

**The Reality:** Grumbling ≠ Leaving

## Current Interview Progress

### 2. Real World Price Increase Results

**Alan's Examples:**
"I've seen an owner raise prices 10% and no one noticed."

**The Testing Method:**
"I've also had customers who do trials where they can isolate different customer sets to test pricing. They almost always gain more gross margin than they lose."

**The Sweet Spot:**
"10-15% usually works depending on the base level, size of purchase and relative importance of the product or service to the customer."

### 3. The Rebranding Strategy

**Alan's Clever Approach:**
"Another way I like to do it is to find a new product or service or a new way to brand an old one. Then raise the price 10-20%. You are no longer compared to your old competitors."

**Key Insight:** Change the comparison, change the price ceiling.

### 4. The Simple Testing Methods

**Alan's Quick Tests:**
"Run a Meta ad for a new deal and see the response you get. Put something out in the market. When a new prospect comes, try it out."

**The Math That Matters:**
"Losing one customer to gain a 10% price increase over years is almost always worth it."

**Competitive Intelligence:**
"Monitor your competition closely. See if you can find a way to pivot what you do so it isn't a direct comparison."

**Key Tactics:**
- Test with ads before real customers
- Try new prices only on new prospects
- Accept that losing one customer might be worth it
- Pivot your positioning to avoid direct comparison

### 5. The Dumbest Pricing Mistake

**Alan's Head-Shaking Moment:**
"They discount before anyone asks them to. They effectively negotiate against themselves."

**The Self-Sabotage:** Offering discounts preemptively out of fear, before the customer even objects to the price.

## The ONE Thing (Alan's Final Answer)

**If you only do one thing (actually two):**
1. "First just test an increase on a segment of leads or current customers. Just try it."
2. "Second, pivot your product or service so you can avoid price comparisons to your competition"

**Why This Works:**
- Testing removes fear with data
- Small segments minimize risk
- Pivoting changes the game entirely
- You escape commodity pricing

**The Bottom Line:** Stop wondering, start testing. And if possible, stop competing on the same field.
