### Topic: Customer Retention & Expansion

**Q: Retention versus acquisition philosophy?**

A: That's a business model question. It's usually cheaper to keep a current customer than to find a new one but there are businesses that are one time or limited use products and services.

**Q: What retention rate should businesses target?**

A: You should benchmark against your industry and obviously compare it to your conversion rate. Make sure conversion is higher than churn.

**Q: How do you understand why customers leave?**

A: Exit interviews can work in professional services, surveys are probably best. You should do multiple follow ups to try to win them back but it's usually over long before they leave. The time to correct it was long before.

**Q: What works for expansion revenue?**

A: Listen to what customers say and cross or upsell based on that. Don't push, pull.

**Q: Customer success versus customer service?**

A: What is the difference between the two? [Note: Alan sees these as essentially the same]

**Q: What metrics predict churn?**

A: These are mostly tech focused questions. I feel like customer success is for software mostly. Same with usage which is what I would look at. For professional services it's customer satisfaction. Same with a lot of other industries.

**Q: How do you handle pricing changes for existing customers?**

A: I test new pricing with new customers and then increase prices for old customers gradually and in waves. Not everyone all at once. The only exception is when I have capacity issues. If there's just too much demand raise prices on everyone.

**Q: Which customers are worth keeping?**

A: This comes down to ICP. Look at the gross margin. Look at the order history. Are they a total pain to serve. Fight for the ones that fit your ideal profile.

**Q: What about loyalty programs?**

A: They are all great depending on the industry. Just design them carefully.

**Q: What's the one thing for retention?**

A: Talk to your customers.
