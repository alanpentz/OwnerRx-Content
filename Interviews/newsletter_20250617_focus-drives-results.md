The One-Page Strategy That Actually Works

Most planning tools have too much information in them

Without a clear plan, a company drifts

Strategic plans are about priorities not detail

StrategyRx puts together a few simple best practices to give you a better method

I've sat through enough strategic planning sessions to know they're mostly theater.

Two days locked in a conference room. Endless PowerPoints. SWOT analyses that tell you nothing. Mission statements that could apply to any company.

Then you walk out with a 47-page document that sits on a shelf until next year's planning retreat.

Another trick is to call something a one-page plan and then fit a bunch of stuff in there by messing with the margins and using both sides of the page.

It’s like the reverse 7th grade essay tactic.

What it leads to is unclear direction that allows companies to drift.

Strategy is about ruthless prioritization. If you don’t prioritize, you don’t have a strategy.

There's a better way.

Marc Benioff built a $250 billion company using a one-page planning tool he scribbled on the back of an American Express envelope in 1999.

It's called V2MOM. Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, Measures.

That's it. Five sections. One page. Every employee at Salesforce can quote it from memory.

While other companies are drowning in strategic documents, Salesforce keeps everyone aligned with something that fits on your phone screen.

Here's what I learned building OwnerRx: If your strategy doesn't fit on one page, it's not a strategy. It's a wishlist.

One page or 350 words forces ruthless prioritization. You can't hide weak thinking behind bullet points and appendices. Every word has to earn its place.

Most strategic plans fail because they try to do everything. V2MOM forces you to pick what actually matters.

I tried this for OwnerRx and immediately saw why it works. But I did a couple of tweaks borrowing from some other great strategic minds.

The first tweak was on obstacles.

I’m a big fan of Richard Rumelt's concept of "The Crux."

The Crux is the single most consequential, solvable challenge you face. The one thing that, if solved, unlocks everything else.

It’s tempting to solve easy problems so that we can feel like we made progress without too much effort. A Crux forces you to focus on the biggest challenge.

So I changed the O in V2MOM to a C.

The second tweak was on the metrics. I’ve become a big supporter of using a North Star metric.

That’s the one metric that, if you move it, you know you’ll succeed. That is your primary and all other metrics flow from it.

Notice the language of those two tweaks. The Crux is the one obstacle that you have to overcome and the North Star is the measure that indicates you’ve overcome it.

The North Star keeps you from chasing vanity metrics. For example, who cares if your website views are up or down if it doesn’t keep customers from cancelling?

Both concepts also force more prioritization. Owners and their teams waste too much time on shiny objects or initiatives that don’t produce results.

Focusing on just one obstacle and one measure helps you overcome that.

I’ve built out a light weight version of the tool I’m going to include in the OwnerRx app. It’s on the website if you want to play with it. There’s no database or authentication so you can enter data and download it but it resets when you leave the page.

The strategy focuses on answering 5 key questions:

**Vision: Where are we going?** One sentence. Present tense. Paint the picture of success as if it already exists.

**Values: What principles guide our decisions?** 3-5 things we hire, fire, and reward people for.

**Methods: How will we get there?** The major initiatives we need to undertake in the next 6-18 months that move the needle. Not everything you could do. Just what you have to do to move The Crux and the North Star to achieve the vision.

**The Crux: What’s the one challenge we must overcome?** See above.

**North Star and Metrics: How will we know whether we are succeeding or failing?** See above

Timeframe: the world is changing fast. Five year plans are a joke. I believe you should do what I’m calling StrategyRx once a year.

That doesn’t mean you need a new vision and values each year but you should make sure it’s all still relevant.

Here's where it gets powerful: Everyone writes a StrategyRx.

The CEO creates the company StrategyRx. Don’t outsource this. Yes, ask your people for input but this is yours. If the team had a vision, they’d run their own companies.

Now each department writes theirs to support it. Every team cascades down from there.

Suddenly everyone from the intern to the executive team is rowing in the same direction. No more "I didn't know that was a priority."

Most strategic plans get written in January and are forgotten by March.

I’m embedding StrategyRx into the meeting rhythm of the company. It stays alive because you:

Break down the methods into quarterly initiatives.

Review progress on the initiatives in your weekly leadership meeting.

Deep dive on initiatives and the North Star at your monthly.

Are you making progress?

Are these still the most important things to work on?

If not, why not? Did we select the wrong methods or did we get distracted by fire drills?

Why is that happening?

If you aren’t executing your strategy, what are you doing? If you are executing it, what are you learning?

The real meat of leadership is the answers to those questions.
