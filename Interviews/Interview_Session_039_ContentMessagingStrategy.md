## The Broadcasting Mistake

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** What's the biggest lie or misconception about content strategy that even smart owners believe?

**ALAN:** That you should talk about what you want to say.

**Key Insight:** Stop broadcasting what YOU think is important. Address what THEY actually care about.

## Content That Converts vs Content That Gets Likes

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** You've written a ton of content that actually works. What's the difference between content that gets likes and content that gets customers? Give me a specific example.

**ALAN:** Good content answers customer questions or shifts their thinking. I'm doing this now with AI. They ask, "what can I do to get started in AI" so I write "here are 4 things to do now." But they don't even know what questions to ask so I give case studies of real owners or me doing things that they could do as well. That shifts their thinking.

**The Two-Level Strategy:**
1. **Level 1:** Answer questions they know to ask
2. **Level 2:** Show them what they don't know they should be doing

**Key:** Case studies make it real, not theoretical

## Finding Your Authentic Voice

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Everyone says "find your voice" but most business content sounds like corporate robots. How does an owner figure out their authentic voice that also converts? What's your process?

**ALAN:** They should get interviewed by someone friendly. I think your authentic voice comes out when you talk about what you know.

**The Voice Unlock Method:**
- Get interviewed, don't "write"
- Talk to someone genuinely curious
- Explain what you know naturally
- Your real voice emerges in conversation
- Then transcribe and edit

## AI as Writing Assistant, Not Ghostwriter

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** AI content generation - everyone's using ChatGPT to write their blogs now. How should owners actually use AI for content without sounding like everyone else?

**ALAN:** I think that transcript method is best. Talk with someone about what you know, then use the LLM to create the content. Go find the best practices on prompting it to develop targeted content.

**The Human-AI Content Process:**
1. Record conversation/interview
2. Use AI to structure and expand
3. Keep human insight and voice
4. AI handles formatting, not thinking
5. Learn proper prompting for your audience

## The Content to Kill

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Last question - what type of content do most small businesses waste time creating that generates zero ROI? What should they stop doing immediately?

**ALAN:** Fancy and overproduced content be it video or something printable. Just get the stuff out there. Value is more important than production value. I see too many generic 5 point lists that tell me what I would have guessed the 5 points were. Get to real stuff people can use and don't already know.

**Stop Creating:**
- Overproduced videos
- Fancy designed PDFs
- Generic "5 tips" lists
- Predictable advice
- Polish over substance

**Start Creating:**
- Raw valuable insights
- Stuff they don't already know
- Real usable tactics
- Case studies with numbers
- Authentic conversation

## The ONE Thing

If an owner only does ONE thing about content strategy, what should it be?

**Get interviewed weekly about what you know, transcribe it, and use AI to turn it into content. Stop writing, start talking. Your authentic expertise beats polished generic content every time.**

2. **Two levels** - Answer known questions AND shift their thinking
3. **Interview for voice** - Your authentic voice comes out in conversation
