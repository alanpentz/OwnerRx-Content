### Topic: Innovation Pipeline

**Q: What does innovation mean to you?**

A: It's all of that. It's new and better ways to do things.

**Q: How do you make time for innovation?**

A: Owners need to shed more low value tasks to focus on innovation. It's the owner's role.

**Q: How do you systematically identify opportunities?**

A: I do this in quarterly strategy meetings. Have the whole team write down 5-10 ideas about what problems everyone in the industry faces. Do it multiple times. It takes practice and getting past the really obvious stuff.

**Q: How do you prioritize innovations?**

A: You don't necessarily pursue any of them. Are they overcomeable? What resource commitment would it take? This is just a business case. You might find 1 out of 500 ideas that will work.

**Q: How do you test without betting the farm?**

A: Use an LLM to do deep research and simulate the solution. Put together a budget and plan. Does it make sense? Ask it to take the role of a skeptic to shoot holes in the idea. Beat it up.

**Q: Customer ideas versus internal ideas?**

A: I had an expression that if a customer asks me for something different I ignore it. If two customers ask me for something different I start asking questions about it. If three ask me for the same thing I launch a new product or service. That said, the problems everyone in the industry has will give you a new customer set, your old competitors. So it depends.

**Q: Incremental versus breakthrough innovation?**

A: They are separate processes handled by separate functions. Incremental is operations. Breakthrough is usually the owner.

**Q: Buy versus build innovation?**

A: This is very risky. Innovation is by definition new. Why would someone with a great new business that's growing fast want to sell to you? You're no Apple, you're an SMB. If it isn't growing why would you buy it? Plus you don't know much about the new innovation probably. I'd say try experimenting and building yourself. AI has dramatically reduced the cost of this.

**Q: How do you create innovation culture?**

A: I think you do what you can to model the behavior and reward it where you see it. Reality is most employees aren't innovators. That's why they are employees. A few will do so and work closely with them.

**Q: What's the biggest innovation mistake?**

A: Putting down too much money on unproven ideas. Don't build castles in the sky.

### Key Insights:
- Innovation is the owner's role - can't delegate breakthrough innovation
- 1 out of 500 ideas might work
- Use LLMs to research and destroy ideas before spending money
- The 1-2-3 customer rule: ignore one, investigate two, launch at three
- Most employees aren't innovators - that's why they're employees

### The ONE Thing:
Don't put too much money on unproven ideas - don't build castles in the sky.
