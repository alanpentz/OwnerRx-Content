## The Multiple Mythology

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** What's the biggest lie or misconception about business valuation that even smart owners believe?

**ALAN:** Most think their company is worth the multiple they read about in an article or that their CPA buddy told them.

**Key Insight:** Generic multiples are fantasy. Your plumbing business isn't worth 5x because you read about a SaaS exit at 5x.

## The Real Value Drivers

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** What actually drives the multiple a business gets? Give me the real factors that separate a 2x from a 6x valuation.

**ALAN:** Customer concentration, owner dependence, profit level, growth, history of steady revenue and long-term customers. How repeatable is the revenue? Is it all owner relationships with customers? Buyers also like when you're offering a small part of the customer's budget but still important. You aren't going to be where they look for savings.

**The 2x vs 6x Checklist:**
- **Customer concentration:** No one over 10% = higher multiple
- **Owner dependence:** Runs without you = higher multiple  
- **Profit level:** Must clear $500K+ minimum
- **Growth trajectory:** Steady growth beats flat
- **Revenue quality:** Recurring beats project-based
- **Relationship ownership:** Team relationships beat owner relationships
- **Budget position:** Small but critical line item = sticky

## The Sellable Threshold

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Most owners don't know their business has no value if they ARE the business. At what point does a business become sellable vs just an expensive job?

**ALAN:** Usually there's a revenue and profit level of above $500-750K in profit. But there has to be something there beyond the owner or else it's just a job and one the buyer will fail at.

**The Hard Truth:**
- Under $500K profit = hard to sell
- Owner-dependent at ANY size = just a job
- Need BOTH profit AND independence
- Buyer must be able to succeed without you

## The 3-5 Year Value Building Play

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** You've been through exits. What's the one thing owners should do NOW to increase their valuation in 3-5 years, that most don't think about?

**ALAN:** They need a real financial picture of the business. What are they running through the business that are personal expenses? Are they artificially boosting profit by not paying themselves a market wage? The other is to get the owner out of key customer relationships and sales if at all possible. That's very hard in small businesses.

**The Two Critical Moves:**
1. **Clean financials:** 
   - Remove personal expenses
   - Pay yourself market wage
   - Show true profit, not lifestyle accounting
   
2. **Transition relationships:**
   - Move key customers to team members
   - Remove yourself from sales
   - Nearly impossible but necessary

## The 80% Reality Check

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Last question - what's the harsh reality check you give owners who think they'll "sell the business and retire" but haven't done the work to make it valuable?

**ALAN:** 80% of businesses aren't worth anything. You have to take money out as you go to build wealth outside the business. Of the remaining 20%, only a few will sell for more than 1-3x profit.

**The Brutal Math:**
- **80% of businesses:** Worth $0 at sale
- **15% of businesses:** Sell for 1-3x profit  
- **5% of businesses:** Sell for 3x+ profit

**Key Insight:** Your retirement plan can't be selling the business. Take money out as you go.

## The ONE Thing

If an owner only does ONE thing about business valuation, what should it be?

**Assume your business is worth zero and build wealth outside it. If you're wrong, it's a nice surprise. If you're right, you're not broke at 65.**
