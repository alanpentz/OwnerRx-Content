## The Global Talent Arbitrage

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** What's the biggest lie or misconception about remote work that even smart owners believe?

**ALAN:** That it can't work. In the modern world with labor shortages in the US, we need to start looking to global talent whenever possible. It's just so much more cost effective.

**Key Insight:** US labor shortage + global talent pool = massive advantage for those who adapt. The "remote doesn't work" belief is expensive denial.

## Starting with Global Talent

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** You mentioned global talent. Most owners are scared of hiring internationally - compliance, time zones, payment. What's the simplest way to start?

**ALAN:** There are great placement agencies out there. Start with low level admin roles but people are hiring marketing managers, salespeople, controllers, accountants, etc. overseas.

**The Progression Path:**
1. Use placement agencies (they handle compliance)
2. Start with admin roles (low risk)
3. Learn the process
4. Scale to managers and specialists
5. Controllers and accountants working great globally

## The Loom + AI Performance System

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** The biggest complaint about remote teams is "I can't tell if they're working." How should owners actually manage and measure remote performance?

**ALAN:** Meet with them regularly like any other direct report and I use Loom and a Loom transcript to help. Every day my marketing manager in Peru does a Loom showing me what he worked on. I watch it if I have time. If not I'll take a week of transcripts and run them through ChatGPT to see what productivity was like.

**The Daily Accountability System:**
- Daily Loom videos showing work
- Visual proof beats time tracking
- Watch daily or batch weekly
- ChatGPT analyzes productivity patterns
- Peru marketing manager = real example

## The In-Person Investment

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Communication and culture are hard with remote teams. What actually works to keep remote employees engaged and aligned?

**ALAN:** It's important to meet in person at some point. Try to create an opportunity for you to go there or for everyone to come together. Once humans have met in person they are much better at working together remotely.

**The Meeting ROI:**
- One in-person meeting changes everything
- Either you go there or bring them here
- Face-to-face creates trust
- Remote works 10x better after meeting
- Investment pays for itself quickly

## The Success Foundation

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Last question - what's the one remote management practice that separates successful remote teams from failures?

**ALAN:** Clear expectations and communication.

**The Simplicity:** Not tools, not tracking, not surveillance. Clear expectations and communication. That's it.

## The ONE Thing

If an owner only does ONE thing about remote team management, what should it be?

**Hire globally through agencies starting with admin roles. Use daily Loom updates for accountability. Meet in person once. Set clear expectations.**
