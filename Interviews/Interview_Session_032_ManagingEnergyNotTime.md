# Interview Session 32: Managing Energy Not Time

**Date:** December 2024
**Topic:** Why energy management beats time management
**Pillar:** Personal Vision/Operations

## The Question

**Interviewer:** Alan, everyone obsesses about time management, but I notice the most productive entrepreneurs aren't necessarily working more hours. What are they doing differently?

## Alan's Response

They're managing energy, not time. Time is finite - everyone gets 24 hours. Energy is renewable, but most people treat it like it's infinite. They schedule back-to-back meetings for 10 hours then wonder why their 6 PM decisions are garbage.

Here's what nobody understands: You don't have 8 productive hours in a day. You have maybe 4. The rest is maintenance mode - emails, meetings, administrative crap. If you waste your 4 peak hours on low-value work, you've wasted your day regardless of how many hours you worked.

## The Energy Audit

**Interviewer:** How do you figure out when those peak hours are?

**The Two-Week Energy Map:**

Track your energy hourly for two weeks. Scale of 1-10. No thinking, just gut rating. You'll find patterns:

**Most common patterns:**
- Morning person: 6-10 AM peak
- Night owl: 8 PM-midnight peak  
- Post-lunch crasher: 2-4 PM dead zone
- Second wind: 4-6 PM mini-peak

Mine? 5-9 AM is gold. 10-2 PM is good. 2-4 PM I'm worthless. 4-6 PM okay. After 6 PM, forget it.

So I do my hardest thinking 5-9 AM. Meetings 10-2. Admin during the crash. Exercise 4-6 to reset. Family time after 6 because work would be garbage anyway.

## The Energy/Task Matching Matrix

**Interviewer:** Once you know your energy patterns, how do you use them?

**High Energy Tasks (Top 20% time):**
- Strategic planning
- Creative work
- Difficult decisions
- Sales calls
- Problem-solving
- Writing/content creation

**Medium Energy Tasks (Middle 40% time):**
- Regular meetings
- Email responses
- Project reviews
- Team check-ins
- Standard decisions

**Low Energy Tasks (Bottom 40% time):**
- Data entry
- Expense reports
- Reading/research
- Filing/organizing
- Routine tasks

Most people do email first thing - peak energy wasted on low-value work. Then they try to be strategic at 3 PM when their brain is mush.

## The Energy Drains and Gains

**Interviewer:** What specifically drains or creates energy for entrepreneurs?

**The Big Energy Drains:**
1. **Context switching** - Jumping between different types of work
2. **Decision fatigue** - Making too many choices
3. **Emotional labor** - Dealing with difficult people/situations
4. **Cognitive overload** - Too much complexity at once
5. **Misalignment** - Doing work you hate

**The Energy Creators:**
1. **Flow state work** - Deep focus on meaningful tasks
2. **Wins/progress** - Completing things
3. **Alignment** - Doing what you're built for
4. **Physical movement** - Exercise, walks
5. **Human connection** - Real conversations (not meetings)

## Real Example: Energy Transformation

**Interviewer:** Can you share how this played out with a specific client?

CEO of a $5M company. Working 70 hours, exhausted, making bad decisions. We tracked his energy. Discovered:
- Peak: 6-10 AM
- Good: 10 AM-1 PM
- Dead: 1-4 PM
- Okay: 4-7 PM
- Done: After 7 PM

His schedule? Staff meeting 8 AM (peak energy on updates). Strategy work at 3 PM (dead zone). Sales calls at 6 PM (exhausted).

**Redesigned schedule:**
- 6-8 AM: Deep strategy work (alone)
- 8-10 AM: Key decisions/creative
- 10 AM-1 PM: Meetings/calls
- 1-2 PM: Lunch/walk (honor the crash)
- 2-4 PM: Admin/email (low energy match)
- 4-6 PM: Team development/coaching
- 6 PM: Done. Hard stop.

Same person, same business, but 50% more productive in 20% fewer hours. Revenue grew 30% in 6 months because his decision quality improved.

## The Entrepreneurial Energy Types

**Interviewer:** Are there different energy profiles for different types of entrepreneurs?

**Four Energy Archetypes:**

**The Sprinter:**
- Massive bursts of energy
- Can't sustain steady pace
- Needs recovery periods
- Best with project-based work

**The Marathon Runner:**
- Steady, consistent energy
- Lower peaks but no crashes
- Can maintain for long periods
- Best with operational roles

**The Wave Rider:**
- Energy comes in waves
- Highly variable day-to-day
- Needs flexibility
- Best with creative/strategic work

**The Solar Panel:**
- Energy tied to environment
- Needs right conditions
- Affected by others' energy
- Best with team/culture work

Know your type. Design your business to match.

## The Energy Protection Protocol

**How to protect your peak energy:**

**1. Block it on calendar** - "Strategic Work" 6-10 AM. No exceptions.

**2. Airplane mode** - Phone off during peak hours. World won't end.

**3. Batch similar tasks** - All calls in one block. All emails in another.

**4. Say no to peak-time meetings** - "I'm not available before 10 AM."

**5. Delegate energy drains** - If it exhausts you, someone else probably enjoys it.

## The Weekly Energy Budget

Think of energy like money:
- You get 100 energy units per week
- Peak hours cost 3 units per hour
- Medium hours cost 2 units
- Low hours cost 1 unit

Budget accordingly:
- 20 units on highest-value work
- 40 units on necessary work
- 20 units on maintenance
- 20 units for recovery/unexpected

Most entrepreneurs spend 60 units on maintenance and wonder why nothing important gets done.

## The Recovery Requirement

**Interviewer:** What about pushing through when you need to?

Pushing through low energy is like driving on fumes - you might make it, but you're damaging the engine. Every hour you push through low energy takes two hours to recover from.

Better to work 4 peak hours than 8 exhausted hours. Output is higher, quality is better, and you're not destroying yourself.

**Non-negotiable recovery:**
- 7+ hours sleep (yes, you need it)
- Daily movement (20 minutes minimum)
- Weekly full disconnect (24 hours ideal)
- Quarterly reset (3-4 days off)
- Annual deep recovery (2 weeks minimum)

Skip recovery and you're borrowing from future productivity at 50% interest.

## The ONE Thing

**Stop managing time and start managing energy. Track your energy patterns for two weeks, then ruthlessly protect your peak hours for your most important work. Four peak hours beat twelve exhausted hours every time.**

## Key Takeaways for Framework

1. **Energy is renewable but not infinite** - Most people have 4 peak hours daily
2. **Match tasks to energy levels** - High-value work in peak hours only
3. **Energy patterns are predictable** - Track for two weeks to find yours
4. **Four energy archetypes** - Sprinter, Marathon, Wave, Solar Panel
5. **Recovery isn't optional** - Skip it and pay 50% interest in future productivity

## Changes Needed to Content

- Replace time management with energy management focus
- Add energy audit tools
- Include energy/task matching matrix
- Add energy archetype assessment
- Emphasize recovery as productivity strategy
