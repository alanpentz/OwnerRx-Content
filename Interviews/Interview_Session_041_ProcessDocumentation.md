## The AI Revolution Nobody Noticed

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** What's the biggest lie or misconception about process documentation that even smart owners believe?

**ALAN:** They don't realize that it's easier than ever to do. LLMs have made it trifling.

**Key Insight:** The massive documentation project of 2020 is now a 30-minute AI task. The barrier disappeared but owners don't know it.

## The Strategic Documentation Priority

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Most owners start documenting the wrong processes first. What should they actually document FIRST and why? Give me a specific example.

**ALAN:** I think you start with the areas where the owner needs to get things off his plate. Second is any area that is causing or experiencing chaos. Third is anything that allows people to focus more on forward-looking work. Generally HR and ops have a lot of low hanging fruit but every area does in the end.

**The Priority Stack:**
1. **Free the owner** - Get stuff off their plate
2. **Fix the chaos** - Document problem areas
3. **Enable forward work** - Stop repetitive questions

**Low-hanging fruit:** HR and ops usually first

## The Loom-to-SOP Method

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** You said LLMs make it trivial now. Walk me through exactly how an owner should use AI to document a process in 2025. What's the actual workflow?

**ALAN:** Just have someone do their job on a Loom video. AI can extract the process from the transcript and you can attach the video to it in your PM software. Notion, Monday, etc.

**The 2025 Documentation Workflow:**
1. Record employee doing the task (Loom)
2. AI extracts process from transcript
3. Attach video + SOP to PM tool
4. Done in 30 minutes, not 3 days

**Key:** No writing required

## From Document to Compliance

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Most SOPs sit in folders and die. How do you make sure processes actually get followed? What's the enforcement mechanism that works?

**ALAN:** Turn it into a checklist that needs to be completed and have someone audit the checklists each week or each month.

**The Enforcement System:**
- Documentation → Checklist (not just document)
- Checklist → Must be completed
- Weekly/monthly audit of completion
- Audit creates compliance, not document

**Truth:** Unaudited SOPs = expensive fiction

## The Two Critical Processes

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Last question - what's the one process that every business should have documented that almost none do, and what's the cost of not having it?

**ALAN:** I like to focus on either how to serve the customer or how to onboard employees. These tend to break with growth as new people come in. The old people get distracted and quality drops.

**The Growth Breakers:**
1. **Customer service process** - Quality dies as you scale
2. **Employee onboarding** - Chaos multiplies with each hire

**The Cost:** Old employees distracted, new ones lost, customers suffer

## The ONE Thing

If an owner only does ONE thing about process documentation, what should it be?

**Record your best employee serving a customer on Loom, use AI to extract the SOP, turn it into a checklist, and audit weekly. This one process protects quality as you grow.**

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI changed everything** - Documentation is now trivial, not massive
2. **Strategic priorities** - Free owner → Fix chaos → Enable forward work
3. **Loom method** - Record, AI extracts, attach to PM tool
4. **Checklists + audits** - Documents don't create compliance, audits do
5. **Two critical processes** - Customer service and employee onboarding
6. **Growth protection** - These processes break first when scaling

## Quotable Moments

- "LLMs have made it trifling"
- "Just have someone do their job on a Loom video"
- "Turn it into a checklist that needs to be completed"
- "The old people get distracted and quality drops"

## For the Playbook Update

### Replace Traditional Documentation With:
- Loom-to-SOP AI workflow
- Strategic priority stack
- Checklist + audit system
- Focus on growth-breakers

### Add Specific Examples:
- Loom recording → AI extraction → PM tool
- HR and ops = low-hanging fruit
- Weekly/monthly audit creates compliance
- Customer service and onboarding break first

### New Tools Needed:
- Loom recording checklist
- AI prompt for SOP extraction
- Audit schedule template
- Growth-breaker process identifier

### Critical Warnings:
- Documents without audits = fiction
- Old documentation methods = waste
- Random documentation = no ROI
- Quality drops as distraction increases
