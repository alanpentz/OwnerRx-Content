## The Self-Funding Default

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** What's the biggest lie or misconception about growth financing that even smart owners believe?

**ALAN:** You should fund growth by generating cash flow. A line of credit is there for sudden growth spurts and rare emergencies. Of course take finance with terms matched to the life of real estate, equipment, etc. But if you have an investor you have a job. There are times when you want to exit or you want to run a PE roll-up play or very rarely there is an opportunity that is so big that you should get VC or PE money. Just know what you are signing up for. You've given up your freedom. Investors want their return and they want it in a set period of time.

**Key Truth:** 
- Default = self-funded through cash flow
- Investors = you now have a job
- Their timeline, not yours
- Freedom traded for speed

## The Right Way to Use Debt

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** You mentioned lines of credit for growth spurts. Most owners misuse credit lines - what's the RIGHT way to use debt in a small business?

**ALAN:** You need to have the money coming in but there's just a timing mismatch. I need to hire right now for a new client who is on board but I don't collect until 60 days from now. That's line of credit.

**The Timing Bridge Principle:**
- Revenue already secured
- Just bridging collection gap
- NOT for "maybe" scenarios
- NOT for hopeful marketing
- The money is committed, just not collected

## Asset Financing Rules

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** What about equipment or real estate? You said match terms to asset life. Give me the specific rules you use for these decisions.

**ALAN:** It's just an investment. Do you need the real estate or equipment? Don't do it to reduce taxes or on a hope. Have a plan but most of these things should be financed. This is what finance is for.

**The Asset Test:**
- Will it generate returns? Finance it
- Tax write-off motivation? Don't buy it
- Speculation? Walk away
- Productive asset? This is what debt is for

## PE as Partial Exit Strategy

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Let's talk about the investor trap. When IS it actually smart to take outside money? You mentioned PE roll-ups - explain when an owner should consider this path.

**ALAN:** I look at it as part of an exit strategy. You need to get money out up front. Don't bet everything on the come but once you are taken care of, it can make sense to use their money for a second bite at the apple. Do your due diligence. Talk to companies they've worked with before and not the ones they give you. You can find old press releases about past investments online.

**The Smart PE Play:**
1. **First bite:** Get your money out, de-risk personal wealth
2. **Second bite:** Play with house money for upside
3. **Due diligence:** Find companies they DON'T reference
4. **Research trick:** Old press releases reveal past deals
5. **Talk to failures:** Not just their success stories

## The Most Dangerous "Safe" Financing

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Last question - what's the most dangerous form of financing that owners think is safe? The one that ruins more businesses than anything else?

**ALAN:** Factoring your receivables is the worst. That's stupid but PE is second. Or using your line of credit to finance operations when revenue isn't already in place to support it.

**The Danger Ranking:**
1. **Factoring receivables** - The death spiral disguised as cash flow help
2. **Line of credit for operations** - Without revenue to support it = path to bankruptcy
3. **PE money** - Lost freedom disguised as growth capital

## The ONE Thing

If an owner only does ONE thing about growth financing, what should it be?

**Fund growth through cash flow. Use credit lines only for timing gaps with committed revenue. Finance productive assets. Take investor money only as partial exit, never for growth.**

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cash flow first** - Default to self-funding
2. **Investors = job** - You lose freedom for their timeline
3. **Credit for timing only** - Bridge committed revenue, not hope
4. **Finance productive assets** - Not tax games
5. **PE as exit** - First bite for safety, second for upside
6. **Factoring kills** - The worst "solution"
7. **Do real diligence** - Find the companies they hide

## For the Playbook Update

### Replace Financing Myths With:
- Cash flow as default funding
- Investor money = expensive job
- Credit lines for timing only
- PE for exit, not growth

### Add Specific Examples:
- New client signed, payment in 60 days = good debt
- Marketing experiment = bad debt
- Equipment that earns money = finance it
- Equipment for tax write-off = don't buy it
- Factoring = business death spiral

### New Tools Needed:
- Cash flow growth calculator
- Line of credit decision matrix
- Asset ROI evaluator
- PE diligence checklist
- Hidden company research guide

### Critical Warnings:
- Factoring receivables = worst option
- PE money = freedom lost
- Tax-motivated purchases = mistakes
- Investor timeline â‰  your timeline
- Find the failed investments, not successes
