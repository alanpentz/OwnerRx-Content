# Interview Session 31: Building Systems Not Heroes

**Date:** December 2024
**Topic:** Why hero culture kills businesses
**Pillar:** Operations/Team

---

## The Question

**Interviewer:** Alan, I see a pattern where businesses become dependent on one or two "heroes" who save the day constantly. These people seem invaluable, but something feels wrong about it. What's your take?

## Alan's Response

Heroes are business cancer. They feel like the solution but they're actually the problem. Every time someone heroically saves the day, they're covering up a system failure. Worse, they become unfireable because "everything would fall apart without them."

Here's the truth: If your business needs heroes, you don't have a business. You have a group of talented people compensating for bad systems. The hero eventually burns out, quits, or holds you hostage for raises because they know you're screwed without them.

## The Hero Paradox

**Interviewer:** But aren't these high performers exactly who you want on your team?

High performers, yes. Heroes, no. There's a difference:

**High Performer:**
- Makes systems better
- Documents what they do
- Trains others
- Scales their impact
- Makes themselves replaceable

**Hero:**
- Bypasses systems
- Hoards knowledge
- Works in isolation
- Creates dependencies
- Makes themselves irreplaceable

The hero feels more valuable short-term, but they're actually destroying value. They're creating a single point of failure.

## The Hero Creation Cycle

**Interviewer:** How do heroes get created in the first place?

**The Predictable Pattern:**

1. **Crisis hits.** System fails or doesn't exist.
2. **Someone steps up.** Usually your best person.
3. **They save the day.** Problem solved, celebration.
4. **No system built.** "Sarah handled it."
5. **Pattern repeats.** Sarah becomes go-to.
6. **Sarah becomes essential.** Can't operate without her.
7. **Sarah burns out or leverages position.**
8. **Business held hostage.**

I watched a company lose 40% revenue when their "hero" developer quit. He was the only one who understood the codebase because he "didn't have time" to document. Translation: He built job security through obscurity.

## The System Solution

**Interviewer:** So how do you build systems instead of relying on heroes?

**The Anti-Hero Playbook:**

**Step 1: Identify your heroes**
Who can't take vacation? Who gets called on weekends? Who does things nobody else can? Those are your heroes/liabilities.

**Step 2: Document their magic**
Shadow them for a week. Write down everything they do. Not high-level - detailed. What screens they look at, what decisions they make, what knowledge they use.

**Step 3: Build the system**
Turn their heroics into processes. Create checklists, templates, decision trees. Make their genius followable by mortals.

**Step 4: Train the backup**
Someone else needs to be able to do 80% of what they do. Not as well, but adequately.

**Step 5: Reward system building, not heroics**
Stop celebrating fire fighting. Celebrate fire prevention. Bonus for documentation, not for saving the day.

## Real Example: De-Heroing a Business

**Interviewer:** Can you share a specific example of this transformation?

Digital agency, $3M revenue. Creative Director was their hero. Every design, every client presentation, every creative decision went through him. Working 70 hours, making $150K, absolutely miserable but couldn't leave.

**Month 1:** Documented his design process. Created style guides, templates, decision frameworks.

**Month 2:** Hired junior designer, had hero train them using documentation.

**Month 3:** Junior handles small projects using system. Hero reviews, doesn't do.

**Month 6:** Three designers using system. Hero only handles top 20% of creative challenges.

**Month 12:** Hero takes 3-week vacation. Business doesn't notice.

Hero became Creative Strategy Officer. Salary went to $200K. Working 40 hours. Business grew 50% because now they could scale creative without him touching everything.

## The McDonald's Principle

McDonald's doesn't hire the best cooks. They hire average people and give them excellent systems. Result? Consistent burgers worldwide from teenagers making minimum wage.

Your business should run on systems so good that average people produce excellent results. If you need rockstars for basic operations, you have a systems problem, not a people problem.

## The Hero Addiction

**Interviewer:** Why do owners keep creating and rewarding heroes despite the problems?

**Three reasons:**

**1. Ego boost:** "Look how important I am, saving the day"
**2. Control illusion:** Heroes report to owner, feels like control
**3. Laziness:** Building systems is harder than finding heroes

Also, heroes are addictive. The adrenaline of crisis resolution feels like progress. Building systems feels boring. But boring businesses are sellable businesses.

## The System Building Framework

**For every hero dependency:**

**Document:**
- What triggers the need?
- What information is required?
- What decisions get made?
- What actions are taken?
- What determines success?

**Systematize:**
- Create checklist/process
- Build decision tree
- Develop templates
- Establish standards
- Define escalation

**Distribute:**
- Train multiple people
- Rotate responsibility
- Measure compliance
- Reward system use
- Penalize bypassing

## The Cultural Shift

**From Hero Culture:**
- "Dave saved the day again!"
- "Thank God for Sarah!"
- "What would we do without Tom?"

**To System Culture:**
- "The process worked perfectly"
- "Anyone could have handled it"
- "The system caught the issue"

This feels less exciting but builds real value.

## The ONE Thing

**Stop celebrating heroes and start building systems. Every time someone saves the day, ask "What system failure did they just cover up?" Document it, systematize it, distribute it. Heroes make you feel safe but keep you vulnerable.**
