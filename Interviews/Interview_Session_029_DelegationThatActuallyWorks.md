## The Question

**Interviewer:** Alan, I hear from every entrepreneur that they need to delegate more, but when they try, things fall apart. Work comes back worse than if they'd done it themselves. What's really going wrong here?

## Alan's Response

Most delegation fails because owners delegate tasks, not outcomes. They say "do this, then this, then this" instead of "achieve this result." When you delegate tasks, you create robots. When you delegate outcomes, you create owners.

Here's the bigger problem - most owners are terrible teachers. They know how to do something but can't explain it. So they delegate badly, get bad results, then conclude "I have to do everything myself." No, you just suck at delegation.

## The Delegation Paradox

**Interviewer:** But how do you delegate when you genuinely are the best at something?

You probably are the best. So what? You can't scale yourself. Would you rather have 100% of your capacity or 80% of three people's capacity? That's 240% output even if each person is worse than you.

But here's the real paradox - people only get better than you when you let them be worse than you first. Every expert was terrible before they were good. If you don't let people fail, they never become excellent.

I had a client who was a brilliant salesperson. Closed 80% of deals. Hired salespeople who closed 40%. Fired them. Hired more. Same result. Know why? He was comparing their day 30 to his day 3,000. Of course they were worse.

## The Levels of Delegation

**Interviewer:** So how do you actually delegate effectively?

**The Five Levels (use them in order):**

**Level 1: "Do exactly this"**
Step-by-step instructions. No thinking required. Good for brand new tasks or people.

**Level 2: "Research and recommend"**
They gather information, you decide. Builds judgment without risk.

**Level 3: "Decide and tell me"**
They decide but you know about it. Can still intervene if needed.

**Level 4: "Decide and inform me later"**
They own it, you're informed. Quarterly or monthly updates.

**Level 5: "Own it completely"**
You don't even want to know. Annual results only.

Most owners jump from Level 1 to Level 5 and wonder why everything explodes.

## The Delegation Framework

**Interviewer:** What's your specific framework for delegating something important?

**The ROPE Method:**

**R - Results:** Define the outcome, not the process. "Reduce customer churn to under 5%" not "Call customers weekly."

**O - Ownership:** One person owns it. Not a committee. Not "we all do it." One name.

**P - Power:** Give them the authority to achieve the result. Budget, hiring, process changes. No responsibility without authority.

**E - Evaluation:** How and when you'll measure success. Weekly? Monthly? What metrics? What does good look like?

If any element is missing, delegation fails.

## Real Delegation in Practice

**Interviewer:** Can you give a specific example of this working?

Marketing agency owner doing everything. $2M revenue, working 70 hours. We picked one thing to delegate completely: client onboarding. Previously took him 4 hours per client.

**Month 1:** Documented his process (Level 1)
**Month 2:** Account manager shadows and assists
**Month 3:** Account manager does it, owner reviews (Level 2)
**Month 4:** Account manager owns it, checks with owner (Level 3)
**Month 5:** Account manager runs it, monthly report (Level 4)
**Month 6:** Completely delegated (Level 5)

First few clients were rocky. Quality dropped to 70% of owner's level. But by month 6, the account manager was better than the owner because that's all she focused on. Owner got back 20 hours/month.

## The Delegation Mistakes

**The Big Three:**

**1. Delegating Without Documentation**
"Just figure it out" isn't delegation, it's abandonment. Document the current way first, then let them improve it.

**2. Delegating Responsibility Without Authority**
"You own sales but I have to approve every discount" isn't delegation, it's a puppet show.

**3. Taking It Back at First Failure**
One mistake and you grab it back? Congratulations, you just trained them to never try again.

## The 70% Rule

If someone can do it 70% as well as you, delegate it. Why 70%? Because:
- They'll improve to 85% within 3 months
- You'll drop to 85% because you're juggling too much
- 70% done is better than 100% not done

The only things you shouldn't delegate at 70%:
- Vision and strategy
- Culture and values
- Key relationships
- Final hiring decisions
- The one thing you're truly world-class at

Everything else? 70% rule applies.

## Building Delegation Muscle

**Start Small:**
- Week 1: Delegate email responses
- Week 2: Delegate meeting scheduling
- Week 3: Delegate report creation
- Week 4: Delegate customer check-ins

Build confidence (yours and theirs) with small wins before big delegations.

## The Trust Account

Every delegation is a deposit or withdrawal from the trust account:
- Successful delegation = deposit
- Failed delegation you don't take back = small deposit
- Failed delegation you take back = huge withdrawal
- Micromanaging = withdrawal
- Celebrating their success = deposit

Most owners are overdrawn. Every delegation fails because there's no trust left.

## The Delegation Diagnostic

**Weekly Questions:**
1. What am I doing that someone else could do 70% as well?
2. What did I take back this week that I shouldn't have?
3. Who grew because I let them struggle?
4. What would happen if I disappeared for a month?
5. Am I delegating outcomes or tasks?

**If you're not uncomfortable with how much you're delegating, you're not delegating enough.**

## The ONE Thing

**Stop delegating tasks and start delegating outcomes. Use the ROPE method - Results, Ownership, Power, Evaluation. Accept 70% quality to get 240% capacity. Let people fail forward or they'll never get better than you.**

## Key Takeaways for Framework

1. **Delegate outcomes, not tasks** - Creates owners, not robots
2. **Five levels of delegation** - Progress through them sequentially
3. **The 70% Rule** - If someone can do it 70% as well, delegate it
4. **ROPE Method** - Results, Ownership, Power, Evaluation
5. **Trust account concept** - Every interaction is a deposit or withdrawal

## Changes Needed to Content

- Replace task delegation with outcome delegation throughout
- Add Five Levels of Delegation framework
- Include ROPE method in management tools
- Add 70% rule to delegation criteria
- Include trust account concept in leadership content
