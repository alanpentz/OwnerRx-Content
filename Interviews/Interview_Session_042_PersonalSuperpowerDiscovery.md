## The Swiss Army Knife Delusion

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** What's the biggest lie or misconception about personal superpowers that even smart owners believe?

**ALAN:** Most owners don't really know theirs explicitly. They think they have to be diversified in their talents or that they should imitate other CEOs.

**Key Insight:** Stop trying to be a Swiss Army knife when you should be a scalpel. Your weird specific talent beats generic CEO cosplay.

## The Flow State Method

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** How does an owner figure out their actual superpower? Not what they wish it was or what sounds good, but what it really is. What's the process?

**ALAN:** Check my exercises in this section. I've laid out my way of getting them there. I focus on having them think about when they are in a flow state.

**The Discovery Process:**
- Identify flow state moments
- When does time disappear?
- What feels effortless to you but hard to others?
- That's your superpower, not what you "should" be good at

## The 40% Growth Story

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Give me a specific example - an owner thinks their superpower is one thing, but it's actually something else. How do they discover the truth?

**ALAN:** It's usually not that they think it is something else, it's that they don't realize the value of being in their flow state. An example recently was two partners in a company that they bought with too much customer concentration. They wanted to both be in the foxhole when that main customer was reducing orders. They were both in the office together splitting operational and sales tasks. But one owner was a pure sales guy. They did this exercise and the other owner realized, why is this guy sitting in the office? Get him out of here 100% and let him sell. 3 months later sales were up 40%.

**The Lesson:**
- Crisis makes owners abandon superpowers
- "All hands on deck" = everyone mediocre
- Specialization during crisis = counterintuitive win
- Result: 40% growth in 3 months

## Converting Guilt to Dollars

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Most owners feel guilty focusing on their superpower because it feels too easy or fun. How do you get them over this mental block?

**ALAN:** I show them the value it produces for the company. They often feel they are boasting or getting a big head but if you say, hey go do this and you'll make $10K or this and you'll save $20, it becomes pretty obvious.

**The Guilt Killer:**
- Superpower hour = $10,000
- Weakness hour = $20
- It's not boasting, it's math
- Fun work that makes money > painful work that loses it

## The 10% to 60% Reality

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Last question - what percentage of owners are actually using their superpower daily vs trapped doing everything else? And what's the single biggest thing stopping them?

**ALAN:** They almost always do it for some portion. But I've seen it go as low as 10% of the time. I want them at 100% but realistically anything north of 50-60% is great.

**The Superpower Usage Reality:**
- Most owners: 10-30% superpower time
- Target: 50-60% minimum
- Ideal: 100% (rarely achieved)
- The gap: 40-50% wasted potential

## The ONE Thing

If an owner only does ONE thing about superpower discovery, what should it be?

**Track your flow state for one week. Note when time disappears and work feels effortless. That's your superpower. Then calculate the dollar value difference between that work and everything else. Use math to kill the guilt.**
