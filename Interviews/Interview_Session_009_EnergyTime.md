## Interview Opening

You've written extensively about the energy crisis owners face - not having enough energy for what matters, wasting it on what doesn't, and the brutal math of time as a finite resource. Let's explore your unvarnished views on how owners should actually manage their energy and time.

## Key Insights Captured

### 1. The Hub and Spoke Trap

**Alan's System Diagnosis:**
"They operate on a hub and spoke system where they are the hub and everyone else is a spoke."

**The Revenue Threshold:**
"That's ok for early days but as you start getting to $2M plus in revenue it gets chaotic."

**The Solution:**
"You need to bring in qualified management hires to start taking things off your plate. They can become another hub."

**Key Insight:** Being the only decision maker works until $2M. After that, you're the bottleneck destroying your own business.

### 2. Why Delegation Actually Fails

**Alan's Starting Framework:**
"First do the exercise I have on what gives an owner energy or drains him and what is important and not important to the business."

**The Admin Delegation:**
"You can delegate unimportant and draining activities to an admin. Make a Loom video showing them how to do the task. That's probably enough."

**The Important Work Reality:**
"For important draining things owners need to spend money on experienced hires and define what they do in terms of outcomes and outputs to sharpen accountability."

**The Two Core Failures:**
"Delegation fails because owners give important work to admins or don't hire a good enough employee."

**The Time Value Blindness:**
"There are also times when the owner doesn't understand the value of his time. Yes you can do something faster yourself but if it keeps you from selling a new customer you're negative on the trade off."

**Key Insight:** You're either giving important work to cheap people or you don't understand that doing it yourself costs you sales.

### 3. The Energy Mapping Discovery

**Alan's Exercise Framework (from Personal Vision materials):**
- Map what gives you energy vs. what drains you
- Cross-reference with what's important vs. unimportant to the business
- Track energy levels throughout the day
- Identify your top 3 energy drains

**The Shocking Patterns Owners Discover:**
- Peak mental energy wasted on admin tasks
- Energy-draining activities scheduled at prime time
- Important work done when exhausted
- 20+ hours weekly on tasks that should be delegated

**The Common Energy Vampires:**
- Email management during peak hours
- Back-to-back meetings with no recharge time
- Context switching between strategic and tactical work
- Doing $20/hour work during $500/hour time slots

**Key Insight:** Most owners have their entire day backwards - doing draining work when fresh and important work when dead.

### 4. The Calendar Structure That Works

**Alan's Simple Solution:**
"Simplest is the block time. Hold time periods up front for key kinds of work and no interruptions."

**The AI Calendar Audit:**
"Another thing is to use Claude and Google Calendar. It can analyze your calendar for you and give you ideas about meetings you shouldn't attend or patterns."

**What This Reveals:**
- Meetings you're in for no reason
- Patterns of wasted time
- Interruption clusters killing productivity
- Time blocks that always get violated

**Key Insight:** Block time for important work first, let everything else fit around it. Use AI to audit where your time actually goes.

## The ONE Thing (Alan's Final Answer)

**If you only do one thing:**
"Hire an admin or an experienced operations hire."

**Why This Works:**
- Immediate time recapture (10-20 hours/week)
- Admin handles the unimportant but necessary
- Ops hire becomes a second hub in your system
- You focus on what only you can do
- ROI is almost instant

**The Bottom Line:** Stop trying to optimize your way out of being overwhelmed. Hire someone tomorrow.
