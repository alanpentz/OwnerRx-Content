## The Question

**Interviewer:** Alan, everyone talks about customer acquisition, but what about keeping them? What's your approach to retention?

## Alan's Response

Retention is profit. Acquisition is revenue. Most businesses are so obsessed with new customers they ignore the ones they have. It's like filling a bucket with holes in it. Doesn't matter how fast you pour if it's all leaking out.

Here's the math nobody does: It costs 5-7x more to get a new customer than keep an existing one. But where do most companies put their best people? Sales. Where do they put their newest, cheapest people? Customer success. That's backwards.

## The Churn Reality

**Interviewer:** What's a concrete example of fixing retention problems?

SaaS company I worked with. 10% monthly churn. They were celebrating hitting $100K MRR, but losing $10K every month. That's 120% annual churn. They'd have to replace every customer plus 20% just to stay flat.

We did exit interviews with 50 churned customers. Know what we found? They didn't know how to use the damn product. Not that it didn't work - they couldn't figure it out. The company had great sales, terrible onboarding.

Solution? We took their best salesperson and made them Head of Customer Success. Revenue went down for two months because sales dropped. But churn fell to 3%. Within 6 months, revenue doubled because customers were actually staying. That's the compound effect of retention.

## The Retention Playbook

**Interviewer:** What's your playbook for reducing churn?

First, measure it honestly. Most companies lie to themselves about churn. "Oh, that customer doesn't count because..." No. Every lost customer counts.

Second, talk to the ghosts. Call customers who left. Not an email survey - actual phone calls. Ask them one question: "What could we have done differently to keep you?" Then shut up and listen.

Third, find the pattern. It's usually one of three things: 
- They didn't get value fast enough (onboarding problem)
- They outgrew you (product problem)
- Someone pissed them off (service problem)

Fourth, fix the real problem, not the symptom. If it's onboarding, don't just add more emails. Redesign the entire first 30 days. If it's product, build what they actually need, not what you think they need. If it's service, fire whoever is pissing off customers, even if they're good at other things.

## The Churn Math That Matters

**Let me show you the compound effect:**

**Company A: 10% monthly churn**
- Start with 100 customers
- After 12 months: 28 customers left
- Need 352 new customers just to maintain 100

**Company B: 3% monthly churn**
- Start with 100 customers
- After 12 months: 69 customers left
- Need 42 new customers to maintain 100

Company B can grow with 1/8th the acquisition effort. That's why retention is everything.

## The Three Churn Patterns

**1. Fast Churn (Month 1-2)**
- Wrong customer (sales problem)
- Expectations mismatch (marketing problem)
- Onboarding failure (success problem)

**2. Medium Churn (Month 3-6)**
- Didn't achieve promised value
- Too complex to implement
- Lack of internal adoption

**3. Slow Churn (Month 7+)**
- Outgrew the solution
- Found better alternative
- Change in their business

Each pattern needs different solutions. Most companies treat all churn the same.

## The Value Velocity Framework

**Time to First Value (TFV):**
- Consumer products: <1 minute
- SaaS tools: <1 day
- Enterprise software: <1 week
- Professional services: <2 weeks

If you're not delivering value inside these windows, you're already losing them.

## The Customer Success Inversion

**Traditional Model (Broken):**
- Best people in sales
- Mediocre people in account management
- Worst people in support
- Result: Great at winning, terrible at keeping

**Inverted Model (Works):**
- Good people in sales
- Best people in customer success
- Solid people in support
- Result: Customers become your sales force

## The Expansion Revenue Secret

Here's what nobody talks about - keeping customers isn't just about reducing costs. It's about expansion revenue. A customer who stays becomes:
- Larger accounts (they buy more)
- Referral sources (they tell others)
- Case studies (they prove value)
- Advisors (they improve your product)

We had a client whose average customer value went from $1,000 to $5,000 over 18 months. Not from raising prices - from customers growing with them. But only if they stayed.

## The Retention Diagnostic

**Weekly Questions:**
1. How many customers did we lose?
2. How long were they with us?
3. What was their lifetime value?
4. Why did they actually leave?
5. Could we have prevented it?

**Monthly Analysis:**
1. Cohort retention curves
2. Churn by customer segment
3. Churn by acquisition channel
4. Revenue churn vs logo churn
5. Win-back success rate

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Churn

Some churn is good. If you're not losing any customers, you're probably:
- Underpriced
- Overservicing
- Afraid to innovate
- Serving too broad a market

The goal isn't zero churn. It's profitable retention. Some customers cost more to keep than they're worth.

## The Exit Interview Script

**Here's exactly what to say:**

"Hi [Name], I noticed you canceled your account. I'm not calling to win you back - that ship has sailed. But I'd love 5 minutes to understand what we could have done better. Your honest feedback will help us improve for future customers. What could we have done differently to keep you?"

Then shut up. Don't defend. Don't explain. Just listen and take notes.

## The ONE Thing

**Stop celebrating new customer wins while your existing customers are walking out the back door. Put your best person on retention, not acquisition. Fix the holes in the bucket before you worry about pouring faster.**

## Key Takeaways for Framework

1. **Retention is profit, acquisition is revenue** - Most companies have this backwards
2. **10% monthly churn = 120% annual churn** - The math is worse than you think
3. **Best people should be in customer success** - Not sales
4. **Three churn patterns need different solutions** - Fast, medium, slow
5. **Some churn is healthy** - Zero churn means you're doing something wrong
