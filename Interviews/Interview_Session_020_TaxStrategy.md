### Topic: Tax Strategy & Optimization

**Q: What's your philosophy on tax strategy?**

A: Conservative in that I don't think you should waste money to avoid taxes and be careful with home office and the like but aggressive in finding real avoidance measures. There is a high ROI on tax knowledge unfortunately. It's easier to save 40 cents on taxes than make another dollar. Here's the bottom line though: always reserve cash for tax payments. That's the first step.

**Q: What's the biggest tax mistake owners make?**

A: They spend a dollar to save 40 cents. They buy trucks or equipment they don't really need just to avoid taxes. Stupid.

**Q: What about entity structure?**

A: That's a legal question and is mostly determined by your type of business. If you are growing to sell and meet the requirements of QSBS then a C-corp could be right. Otherwise do some kind of pass through.

**Q: What about S-Corp reasonable salary?**

A: That's up to the owner and their risk level but always remember in your head what it would take to replace yourself with a W-2 salary. You should back that out of profit to truly understand your business.

**Q: Personal versus business tax optimization?**

A: It's all one bucket so use whatever works and find a good CPA. They are hard to find so you'll have to go through a bunch.

**Q: What about retirement planning and tax-deferred strategies?**

A: They are for professional businesses. You can't be competitive without them and there are a lot of low cost options now. Shop around though because there are a lot of unscrupulous operators.

**Q: What about tax credits and incentives?**

A: Love them if you can meet the requirements. R&D is a definite. Energy can be good depending on the current status. Economic zones are better for real estate and appreciated assets for capital gains relief. Most owners should stay away.

**Q: How do you handle tax planning throughout the year?**

A: You should review your monthly numbers every month and project tax liability for the quarter and year.

**Q: What about state and local tax strategies?**

A: Not much. Just try to stay out of California, New York, and Illinois. They are onerous.

**Q: What's the one thing about tax strategy?**

A: Reserve cash for tax payments.
