### Topic: Leadership Development

**Q: What's the biggest mistake in developing leaders?**

A: They try to promote unqualified internal people because they are loyal.

**Q: When to promote internally vs hire externally?**

A: In a fast growing business you almost always need to hire outside for better people as you grow. If you are hiring for a director of ops, has anyone in your current organization done that job? Have you as the CEO done that job before for a company of your size? If no, go hire someone who knows what they are doing. If you promote from within it's the blind leading the dumb. 

If you have a really good team in place and there is a great person one level down and someone else has done the role before so there's some processes and expectations, then you can promote from within. Or if the CEO has really done that job before at another company of similar or greater size, he can train someone but otherwise hire from outside. If the company is growing fast there are other lower level roles internal people can fill. These bigger management roles need experience and proven playbooks to help you stay ahead of growth.

**Q: How do you prevent organ rejection of external hires?**

A: I make it clear the outcomes and outputs that person will be responsible for. If the person in the new role is good and some other employee can't get on board then they get fired.

**Q: How do you prepare for 50% leadership turnover at 2-3X growth?**

A: Most people think they will be in the 50% that stays. You need to give people clear feedback and get those roles clear with outcomes and outputs. It emerges clearly if you do this who needs to go. I say to someone: we need you to get this role to this level in 3-5 years. If you are on board with that let's do it and then see who wants to sign on for the next round.

**Q: What actually develops leaders?**

A: Training is a bit useful especially for very specific skills like manager training or maybe AI skills. But the two things that work are working with people that are better than you and know more than you and taking progressively harder assignments. People figure it out on their own. No training program can really do it. The exception is in very low level front line roles where it's really mechanistic.

**Q: How do you identify leadership potential?**

A: It's like porn, you know it when you see it. I use that team evaluation test where each person gets ranked high medium or low on alignment with values, past 6 months performance, and potential for the next level. Then I ask if we would enthusiastically rehire them. Do that once or twice a year and you know who your good people are.

**Q: Should leaders understand other functions?**

A: I want them to be team players but they need to know their role and it doesn't matter if they can do another role.

**Q: How do you transfer real decision authority?**

A: Stop answering people's questions about that stuff. If people won't do it, make it a performance issue.

**Q: What leadership roles to fill first?**

A: It's always about offsetting the important areas that drain the owner first. I tend to find that is operations, HR, and anything admin or basic finance. I usually go ops first and then HR or finance.

**Q: How should leadership teams operate?**

A: You meet once a week and all major issues are brought to that meeting. You list all issues and one person is appointed to make sure all issues get a resolution. No moving on with remaining ambiguity. Prioritize the issue against the Crux. If major issues are dealt with outside the meeting why is this? This is usually the sign of a dysfunctional team. You should be solving problems together as a team every week.

### Key Insights:
- Loyalty doesn't qualify someone for leadership
- Fast growth = hire externally for senior roles
- Frame roles as 3-5 year tours with clear levels
- Development = better people + harder assignments, not training
- Weekly leadership meetings with zero ambiguity allowed

### The ONE Thing:
In fast-growing companies, hire externally for senior roles. Internal people can't grow fast enough unless someone has done it before.
