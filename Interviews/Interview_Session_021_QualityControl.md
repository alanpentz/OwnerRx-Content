### Topic: Quality Control Systems

**Q: What does quality mean in your business?**

A: Customer satisfaction is key for professional services and most businesses. Rework might matter a lot more for manufacturing.

**Q: How do you measure quality in knowledge work?**

A: We usually have a quality system in place with multiple reviewers and monthly reviews of overall quality.

**Q: How do you diagnose quality problems?**

A: You have to start with the immediate problem to stop the bleeding, then you need to do root cause analysis. Talk through the current process. Is there a bottleneck and underperforming resource etc.

**Q: Quality versus speed tradeoffs?**

A: You can only optimize two of those three factors. I make clear the trade off to the customer. It's their choice.

**Q: How do you maintain quality as you scale?**

A: It's very hard. That's where middle management comes in. You need a layer of managers to sit over the work. And they need a process they are running with KPIs we can monitor. That's just about building the system.

**Q: What about using AI for quality control?**

A: It's a huge help. An LLM is a great editor. Running everything through them to check customer personas, check for errors, etc. is key. Of course a human needs to be in the loop here. Sometimes the models can make up new requirements that no one asked for.

**Q: How long do you coach poor quality performers?**

A: We do 30 day performance improvement plans. That person should have received feedback multiple times before that but you can't let it go on for months.

**Q: What about quality certifications?**

A: They are valuable for the customers you can get but you can build a more effective system yourself. They are branding and a bit of moat sometimes so worth it.

**Q: Standardization versus customization?**

A: Those are different business models. Pick one and stick to it. They have different economics, different systems, etc.

**Q: How do you implement something you're not an expert in?**

A: I usually ask an LLM.
