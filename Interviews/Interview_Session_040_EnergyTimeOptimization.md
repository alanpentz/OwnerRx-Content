**Subject:** Alan Pentz

## The Value Per Hour Reality

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** What's the biggest lie or misconception about productivity that even smart owners believe?

**ALAN:** It's all about the value of the hours you are working on. Owners need to focus on dumping the $10-20/hour tasks for the $10,000 ones.

**Key Insight:** Stop counting hours, start measuring value. 80 hours of $20 work < 1 hour of $10,000 work.

## The $500K Hour vs The $10 Hour

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** You talk about energy a lot. Give me a specific example - what's a high-energy time for most owners that they waste on low-value work, and what should they be doing instead?

**ALAN:** Most owners are good at some combo of system building, sales, and marketing. Figuring out a new system for marketing could be a $500,000 hour. Paying bills to vendors is a $10 hour.

**The Energy Mismatch:**
- Peak creative energy → wasted on admin
- $500K system design → pushed to "someday"
- Bill paying at 9am → criminal waste
- Game-changing work → gets the scraps

## Good Tired vs Bad Tired

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Most owners say they don't have energy at the end of the day. But that's backwards - how should they structure their day to protect energy for what matters?

**ALAN:** They should work on the things that give them energy. When I'm working on something new that could change the game I might come home tired but it's a good and satisfied tired.

**The Energy Truth:**
- Energy-giving work = fulfilled exhaustion
- Energy-draining work = empty depletion
- Same hours, opposite outcomes
- Structure day around energy-giving tasks

## The Meeting Diet

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Meetings are energy vampires for most owners. What's your rule for deciding which meetings to take and which to kill?

**ALAN:** I like to say that owners should only do a weekly meeting and regular check-ins with direct reports. That's it for internal meetings. They also need to talk with customers but focus more time on external meetings.

**The Only Meetings That Matter:**
1. Weekly team meeting
2. Direct report check-ins
3. Customer conversations

**Everything else = theater**

## Breaking the "CEO Should" Rules

**INTERVIEW AGENT:** Last question - what's the one energy management hack that changed your business life that nobody talks about?

**ALAN:** Doing less stuff that drains me that a "CEO is supposed to do." I spent less time talking with employees that weren't direct reports. I stopped even paying attention to benefits except for the last step to make a decision. I stopped getting involved in most things that weren't growth, key customers, or innovation related.

**The Liberation List:**
- Stop talking to non-direct reports
- Ignore benefits/admin until final decision
- Only focus on: growth, key customers, innovation
- Let go of "supposed to" activities
- CEO theater is optional

## The ONE Thing

If an owner only does ONE thing about energy optimization, what should it be?

**Identify your $10,000+ per hour activities and do them during peak energy. Dump everything else that a "CEO is supposed to do" but drains you. Good tired beats bad tired every time.**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Value > Hours** - One $10K hour beats eighty $20 hours
2. **Peak energy mistmatch** - Stop wasting morning on admin
3. **Good tired vs bad tired** - Energy-giving work fulfills even when exhausting
4. **Meeting diet** - Weekly, direct reports, customers. That's it.
5. **Break "supposed to" rules** - Most CEO activities are theater
6. **Focus trinity** - Growth, key customers, innovation only
