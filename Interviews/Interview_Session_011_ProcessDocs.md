## Interview Opening

Everyone talks about documenting processes and creating SOPs. Most owners have a graveyard of half-finished Google Docs that no one reads. Meanwhile, everything still runs through them because "it's faster to just do it myself." Let's talk about what actually works for process documentation in the real world.

## Key Insights Captured

### 1. The System vs Document Reality

**Alan's Solution:**
"They need to get a software tool in place or some system where they can get people to use checklists. Then you can audit the checklists."

**The Outcomes Connection:**
"I also believe the outcomes and outputs approach to job descriptions helps with this."

**The Tool Reality:**
"There are tons of project management and checklist apps out there. Pick one and have someone audit it every day or every week."

**Key Insight:** Documentation fails because it's static. Checklists in software get used because they can be audited and enforced.

### 2. The Video-to-Checklist Method

**Alan's Process Hack:**
"Use a video or record yourself with an AI notetaker. Run the transcript through ChatGPT or equivalent and have it extract the SOP and turn it into a checklist."

**The Enforcement Reality:**
"Auditing makes people follow the list and explicitly calling it out in the job description and performance reviews."

**The Complete System:**
1. Record yourself doing the task
2. AI extracts the steps
3. Turn into auditable checklist
4. Link to job descriptions
5. Check in performance reviews

**Key Insight:** Don't write documentation. Record it, let AI structure it, then audit compliance.

### 3. The Documentation Priority Order

**Alan's Actual Sequence:**
"I started with financial tasks because I needed the financial data."

**Financial First:**
- "When and how invoices are sent"
- "When and how expenses and receipts are collected"
- "I target 2 weeks after end of month for the month to close"

**Then The People Systems:**
"Then I moved on to employee onboarding and then to client onboarding and then project reviews"

**The Priority Order:**
1. Financial processes (you need the data)
2. Employee onboarding (stop repeating yourself)
3. Client onboarding (consistency = quality)
4. Project reviews (systematic improvement)

**Key Insight:** Start with finance - you can't manage what you can't measure. Everything else follows.

### 4. The Simple Audit System

**Alan's Delegation:**
"I delegate auditing to a controller or admin."

**The Weekly Rhythm:**
"Have a report sent to you the day before your weekly meeting. What checklists were complete and which are missing."

**The Accountability Loop:**
"Also have a target in the weekly meeting where missed checklists or processes will show up."

**The Complete System:**
- Controller/admin owns auditing (not you)
- Weekly report before meeting
- Shows completed vs missed checklists
- Missing items become meeting topics
- Creates natural accountability

**Key Insight:** Don't audit yourself. Have someone report to you weekly. Missing checklists become meeting agenda items.

## The ONE Thing (Alan's Final Answer)

**If you only do one thing:**
"Tell everyone they have to come to a weekly meeting prepared to talk about how they followed all the processes."

**Alan's Alternative Power Move:**
"Or make everyone do a video about how they do a process, run it through an LLM and then bring the checklist to the meeting to present."

**Why This Alternative Works:**
- Forces everyone to document their own work
- Creates ownership of the process
- LLM extracts consistency from chaos
- Public presentation ensures quality
- Builds library of processes automatically

**The Bottom Line:** Either make them report on compliance OR make them create their own process docs. Both use public accountability as the enforcement mechanism.
