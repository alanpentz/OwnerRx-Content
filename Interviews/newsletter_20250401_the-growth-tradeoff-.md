Why More Revenue Doesn't Always Mean More Freedom

Welcome to the Owner Institute Newsletter where we talk about getting owners working on and not in their businesses.

In this week‚Äôs issue:

Why growth often means temporary steps backward in freedom

Finding sustainable sweet spots

Different types of owner independence at different revenue levels

‚úÇÔ∏èThe Small Business Administration (SBA) announced plans to cut approximately 2,700 jobs, representing 43% of its workforce, as it aims to return to pre-pandemic staffing levels. Read it here.

ü´§**High Rents Challenge Small Businesses**: Many small businesses continue to struggle with elevated rental costs, forcing some owners to raise prices or relocate. Despite other cost reductions, rent remains a significant financial burden.

Admiral Ackbar - "It's A Trap!"

Here's a confession: When I was at $5 million in revenue, I had more freedom than I did at $12 million.

Sounds crazy, right? While we grow our businesses to make more money, most of also want to have more freedom, more flexibility, more control over our lives along with it. At least that's what we tell ourselves as we grind away for years.

But here's the trap nobody warns you about: At certain revenue stages, you actually take steps backward in freedom before you can move forward again.

I've watched business owners chase growth thinking it's the path to freedom, only to find themselves more trapped than ever. They had more money, sure. But they also had:

More employees depending on them

More clients with bigger expectations

More complex problems to solve

More systems breaking down

More of everything except time

At my first company, I hit a pretty good spot after grinding for several years at about $5m. We were making good money and it felt like the team was finally on top of everything. It didn‚Äôt last.

The changes I‚Äôd put in place resulted in fast growth. A year or two later when we were approaching $10 million, I found myself working 60+ hour weeks again - something I thought I'd left behind at $3 million.

What I've learned is that owner freedom doesn't increase in a straight line with revenue. Instead, it‚Äôs more like a squiggly line:

You're doing everything. Freedom is minimal at this stage, especially early on, but you‚Äôre the only one around for much of this period so there aren‚Äôt a lot of other options. But if you bring in the right supporting labor as you grow, you can get to a good place by $750k-1m. You‚Äôre essential to everything but it‚Äôs manageable.

If you keep selling more, eventually the work starts to outstrips your ability to deliver easily. Systems start to break and the team you have is dropping balls. At this stage owners need to consider making their first real management hire-someone who can run a part of the business without the owner‚Äôs constant oversight.

Around $5 million, many owners hit a sweet spot once they find that hire or hires that fit. Sometimes it takes a while. I took me 3 years and multiple attempts at the right hire.

Once you get it right though, it takes some pressure off. At this stage you can get systems in place that are good enough and have a small team you trust. Profitability spikes up and your making good money. Work-life balance starts to feel possible.

As you grow, complexity increases faster than your systems and people can handle. That great management hire at $3m in revenue isn‚Äôt looking so good anymore and you find yourself promoting other promising people who quickly reach their capacity.

Unfortunately, the business can grow faster than the capabilities of the people running it, including yours. Suddenly you're being pulled back into the business. Your calendar fills up. Your phone never stops. You've got more money but less time.

The key to getting over the backslide is to realize that your team isn‚Äôt going to be able to grow quickly enough. You‚Äôll need to replace people in key positions. Now that you are bigger, you can afford and should bring in people with outside experience and expertise.

If you survive the backslide and build the right team and systems, real freedom becomes possible. But it doesn't happen automatically with growth - it happens when you deliberately build a business that runs without you.

How do you know if you're in a freedom trap? Look for these signs:

You're making more money but working more hours

You've hired more people but have less time

You've grown your revenue but can't take a real vacation

Your business feels more complicated than it did a year ago

You're being pulled back into details you thought you'd escaped

After hitting this freedom trap at $5-10 million, I realized I needed a completely different approach. Here's what actually worked:

Every time you double or triple in size, expect to rebuild about 50% of your systems and your senior team. This isn't failure - it's normal.

There are revenue levels where you can find equilibrium. Once the system and team have caught up you can stabilize the business again. It‚Äôs often good to take a breath at these sweet spots before rushing into the next trap.

I spent years promoting the wrong people - some were good for a lower level role but couldn‚Äôt learn quickly enough to keep up with the growth or the company. Others were great at their jobs but couldn‚Äôt build an effective team under them. The breakthrough came when I hired leaders who could truly build and run their departments without me.

Not guidelines or suggestions, but actual systems that work the same way every time, whether you're there or not.

Ask yourself: What kind of freedom do you actually want? Time freedom? Financial freedom? Decision freedom? Each requires a different strategy.

The real secret to freedom isn't endless growth - it's building a business that serves your life, not the other way around.
