## Key Insights Captured

### 1. The Big Misconception
**Alan's Contrarian Hiring Sequence:**
"I like to challenge owners to think about whether a role can be done to 85% effectiveness with automation and AI first and then can we hire global talent second and only then hire domestically"

**The Traditional Trap:**
- Owners default to local hiring first
- Never consider AI/automation as alternative
- Miss global talent opportunities

**Alan's Hierarchy:**
1. First ask: Can AI do this to 85% effectiveness?
2. Then ask: Can global talent do this?
3. Last resort: Hire domestically

### 2. Real Examples - The $60K Saves

**Marketing Lead → Claude AI:**
- **Plan:** Hire marketing lead for content ($60-80K)
- **Reality:** Built Claude project with past writing examples
- **Process:** Feed interview transcripts → get social content
- **Cost:** ~$20/month vs $60K/year
- **Effectiveness:** 85% as good, 100x faster

**Marketing/Customer Service → Global Team:**
- **Traditional cost:** Full domestic team
- **Global solution:** "Relatively sophisticated back offices for 20 cents on the dollar"
- **Result:** Same or better quality at 80% cost reduction

## Content Enhancements for Hiring Subpillar

### Replace Entire Framework:
**Old:** "How to find and hire A-players"  
**New:** "The AI-First Hiring Decision Tree"

### Add New Decision Framework: "The 85% Rule"
Before posting any job, ask in this order:
1. **Can AI do this to 85% quality?** → Use AI
2. **Can global talent do this remotely?** → Hire globally  
3. **Must it be done locally?** → Only then hire locally

### Add Reality Check Box:
⚠️ **Alan's Math:** "$60K marketing lead or $20/month Claude subscription that works weekends? This isn't hard math."

### Add New Tool: "Role Automation Audit"
For any role you're about to hire:
- List the top 10 tasks they'll do
- Test each with AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Mark which hit 85% quality threshold
- Calculate: If >50% can be automated, don't hire

## Current Interview Progress

### 3. The 85% Effectiveness Test

**Alan's Revolutionary Method:**
"I recommend that owners first define a job in a different way. Think about the outcomes and outputs a job produces."

**The Framework:**
1. **Define the Outcome for Customer:** "Like a happy customer after a well-run event or a richer customer after we got them 10 new clients"
2. **Define the Outcome for Company:** "A successfully completed service done to these standards which creates this amount of repurchasing"
3. **Walk Backwards:** Map all major outputs needed to achieve those outcomes, all the way back to stage zero
4. **Let AI Interview You:** "Have an LLM interview you with this method"
5. **The Test:** "Then ask: can 85% of this work be done by an automated tool or LLM? Show me exactly how and which tool"

**Key Insight:** Stop thinking about hiring a "person for a role" - think about achieving outcomes and then see what requires a human.

### 4. Global Talent Reality Check

**Alan's Myth-Buster:**
"People are people all over the world. Time zones and language are barriers but much less than you think."

**The Quick-Start Method:**
1. **Start with Agency:** "Go to an experienced global talent placement agency. This can be more expensive but it's the best way to dip your toe in"
2. **Learn and Scale:** "After you place a couple of people you can move on to advertising yourself on local job boards or getting bulk discounts from recruiters"
3. **Use Your Team:** "Your global employees can also be recruiters for you"

**Key Enabler:** "The payment services make paying salaries easy now" - No more wire transfer nightmares

## The ONE Thing (Alan's Final Answer)

**If you only do one thing:** 
"Go to outcomes and output descriptions. It creates much more clarity and accountability about what you need from a position."

**Why This Matters:**
- Forces you to think about RESULTS not ACTIVITIES
- Makes it obvious what can be automated
- Creates clear accountability for whoever/whatever does the work
- Prevents hiring for vague "support" roles

**The Shift:** Stop hiring "a marketing person" → Start solving for "10 quality leads per week"
