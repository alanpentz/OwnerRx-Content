## Full Marketing Entry Hook

---

**Hook:** You promoted your best performer to manager and they're drowning. Meanwhile, your brilliant VP is bored managing day-to-day operations. The problem isn't effort—it's cognitive mismatch.

**Why now?** 46% of new managers fail within 18 months. You're either promoting people beyond their capability or wasting talent in roles beneath them. Both cost you dearly.

**Problem explained in plain English:** Every role requires a specific thinking time horizon. A supervisor thinks in weeks, a manager in months, a director in years, a VP in multiple years. Put someone in a role beyond their cognitive capability and they fail—not from lack of effort but from mental overload. Put them below their capability and they quit from boredom.

**1-Minute First Win:** Ask yourself: "What's the longest time frame I can genuinely think about and plan for?" If it's less than 2 years and you're trying to build a 5-year strategy, you've found your problem.

**Ask Next:** How many promoted stars have failed in management roles? How many high-potential people have quit from boredom? *(This reveals the capability mismatch pattern)*

## The Time Span Framework

### The 5 Cognitive Strata

**Stratum I: Direct Output (1 day to 3 months)**
- Thinks in terms of tasks and immediate results
- Perfect for: Individual contributors, frontline workers
- Fails when: Asked to manage others or plan beyond quarter

**Stratum II: Diagnostic (3 months to 1 year)**
- Sees patterns, can coordinate multiple activities
- Perfect for: Supervisors, team leads
- Fails when: Required to think strategically beyond annual cycle

**Stratum III: Alternative Paths (1 to 2 years)**
- Understands trade-offs, can manage managers
- Perfect for: Managers, department heads
- Fails when: Asked to transform organization or 5-year planning

**Stratum IV: Parallel Systems (2 to 5 years)**
- Manages complexity, multiple systems simultaneously
- Perfect for: Directors, VPs of major functions
- Fails when: Required to envision 10-year transformation

**Stratum V: Total System (5 to 10 years)**
- Shapes entire organizations and markets
- Perfect for: Presidents, CEOs of major companies
- Rare capability: Only 1-2% of population

### The Assessment Process

**30-Minute Capability Evaluation:**

**Part 1: Time Horizon Questions (10 minutes)**
- What's the longest project you've successfully planned and executed?
- How far ahead can you genuinely envision and plan?
- What time frame feels comfortable vs. overwhelming?

**Part 2: Complexity Handling (10 minutes)**
- Describe a complex problem you've solved
- How many variables can you juggle simultaneously?
- When do you feel mentally overloaded?

**Part 3: Role Requirement Match (10 minutes)**
- What does this role require in time horizon?
- What complexity must be managed?
- Is there a capability-requirement match?

## Life Cycle Integration

### Your Organization's Life Stage Determines Needs

**Startup/Infancy Stage:**
- Needs: Stratum II-III leadership
- Focus: Daily execution, quick pivots
- Mistake: Hiring Stratum V executive too early

**Growth/Go-Go Stage:**
- Needs: Stratum III-IV leadership
- Focus: Systems while maintaining agility
- Mistake: Keeping Stratum II leader too long

**Maturity/Prime Stage:**
- Needs: Stratum IV-V leadership
- Focus: Long-term strategy, market shaping
- Mistake: Not developing next-level capabilities

**Renewal/Decline Stage:**
- Needs: Stratum V transformation leader
- Focus: Reinvention, major pivots
- Mistake: Promoting based on tenure not capability

## Implementation by Business Size

### Small Business (Under $2M)
**Founder + Key People Assessment:**
- Evaluate owner's true capability level
- Assess 2-3 key employees
- Identify capability gaps
- Plan development or hiring
- Time: 2 hours total

### Mid-Size Business ($2M-$10M)
**Management Team Evaluation:**
- Full leadership team assessment
- Map capabilities to role requirements
- Identify mismatches
- Create development plans
- Time: Half-day workshop

### Large Business ($10M+)
**Organization-Wide Mapping:**
- Assess all management levels
- Create capability heat map
- Succession planning based on capability
- Strategic role design
- Time: Multi-day process

## Real-World Discoveries

### Construction Company ($8.5M)
**Discovery:** Owner was Stratum III trying to do Stratum V strategic planning
**Solution:** Hired Stratum IV COO to bridge gap
**Result:** Owner focused on what she did best, business thrived

### Distribution Business ($1.8M)
**Discovery:** Warehouse supervisor had Stratum III capability, underutilized
**Solution:** Promoted to Operations Manager
**Result:** Transformed operations, enabled growth

### Professional Services ($4.2M)
**Discovery:** Senior managers all Stratum II, creating bottleneck
**Solution:** Developed two to Stratum III, hired one Stratum IV
**Result:** Removed owner from daily operations

## The PAEI Balance Check

### Every Organization Needs Four Roles:

**P - Producer (Get Things Done)**
- Short-term focus
- Results oriented
- Usually Stratum I-II

**A - Administrator (Create Order)**
- Systems and processes
- Risk management
- Usually Stratum II-III

**E - Entrepreneur (Drive Change)**
- Innovation and growth
- Future vision
- Usually Stratum III-IV

**I - Integrator (Unite People)**
- Culture and cohesion
- Conflict resolution
- Can be any Stratum with EQ

**The Balance Test:**
Rate your organization 1-10 on each. Below 5 in any area = critical gap.

## Common Capability Mismatches

### The Peter Principle in Action

**Scenario 1: Star Salesperson → Sales Manager**
- Was: Stratum I individual contributor
- Now needs: Stratum II-III capability
- Result: Can't think beyond personal production
- Solution: Development program or return to sales

**Scenario 2: Good Manager → Poor Director**
- Was: Stratum III managing department well
- Now needs: Stratum IV strategic thinking
- Result: Overwhelmed by complexity
- Solution: Mentoring or different role

**Scenario 3: Brilliant VP → Bored and Leaving**
- Has: Stratum V capability
- Stuck in: Stratum III role
- Result: Frustrated and disengaged
- Solution: Expand role or lose them

## Development Strategies

### Growing Capability (When Possible)

**Stratum I → II Development (6-12 months):**
- Assign projects with 3-6 month horizons
- Teach pattern recognition
- Practice coordinating others
- Success rate: 70%

**Stratum II → III Development (1-2 years):**
- Strategic project involvement
- Managing managers training
- System thinking education
- Success rate: 50%

**Stratum III → IV Development (2-5 years):**
- Executive education
- Board exposure
- Complex problem assignments
- Success rate: 30%

**Truth:** Not everyone can develop to higher strata. Better to match current capability than force development.

## Warning Signs of Mismatch

### Person Above Their Capability:
- Constantly overwhelmed
- Can't see the big picture
- Makes tactical decisions when strategic needed
- Works extremely hard but fails

### Person Below Their Capability:
- Bored and disengaged
- Over-complicates simple things
- Challenges everything
- Looking for new opportunities

## The Restructuring Opportunity

### Once You Know Capabilities:

1. **Restructure roles to match capabilities**
2. **Create development paths for high-potentials**
3. **Hire for capability gaps**
4. **Stop promoting based on performance alone**
5. **Design succession based on capability**

## The Universal Truth

**"A Stratum III person in a Stratum V role will fail no matter how hard they try. A Stratum V person in a Stratum III role will quit no matter how much you pay them."**

Success isn't about effort or intelligence—it's about matching cognitive capability to role requirements. Get this right and everything becomes easier.
