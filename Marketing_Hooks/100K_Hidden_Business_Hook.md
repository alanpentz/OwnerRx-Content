**Hook:** Your business is hiding 8-12% of revenue in 5 predictable places—here's the 30-day recovery plan

**Why now?** While you're stressed about growth, you're hemorrhaging profits through subscription zombies, pricing mistakes, inefficient processes, forgotten receivables, and tax oversights

**Problem explained in plain English:** Right now, your business is leaking money in at least 5 predictable places. Not pennies—we're talking 8-12% of your annual revenue, sitting there like forgotten cash in old coat pockets. The average $2M business has $100K+ hiding in these gaps. You don't need new customers; you need to plug leaks and mine gold you already own.

**Industry-Specific Examples:**
- **Service Businesses:** Unbilled scope creep, underpriced contracts, slow collections
- **Manufacturing/Distribution:** Vendor overpayment, inventory inefficiencies, pricing errors
- **Professional Services:** Write-offs, realization rates, subscription redundancies
- **Construction:** Change order leakage, equipment inefficiencies, warranty callbacks

**1-Minute First Win:** Calculate right now: (Your Gross Margin ÷ Admin Salaries) = Your ratio. If it's under 4x, you're bleeding $2K/month minimum.

**Ask Next:** What's your current monthly gross margin and total admin payroll? *(ask one question at a time; store answers)*

**Data We Need:** 
- P&L statement (gross margins, admin costs)
- AR aging report
- Customer list with last purchase dates
- Owner time tracking for one week
- Vendor contract list

**Turn On Reminder:** 
- **iOS:** "Hey Siri, every Monday 8am remind me to check my $100K progress tracker"
- **Android:** "Ok Google, every Monday at 8am remind me: Review $100K treasure map"
- **Calendar:** "Title: $100K Progress Check | Mon 8am | Alert 10 min before"
