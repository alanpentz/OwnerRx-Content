# The $100K Hidden in Your Business Hook Generator

## Primary Hook Variants

### Hook A: "Find $100K in 14 days without a single new customer"

### Hook C: "The 50/50 Formula: Cut $50K costs, add $50K sales in 2 weeks"

## Full Marketing Entry Hook

---

**Hook:** Your business is hiding $100K—find $50K in costs, $50K in sales in 14 days

**Why now?** Just saw your P&L: admin costs over 40% of gross margin, AR over 45 days, and you're in delivery 40+ hours/week

**Problem explained in plain English:** Every SMB has $100K hiding in plain sight—bleeding through inflated admin costs, slow collections, unbilled work, and ignored customer expansion opportunities. You don't need new customers; you need to plug leaks and mine gold you already own.

**1-Minute First Win:** Calculate right now: (Your Gross Margin ÷ Admin Salaries) = Your ratio. If it's under 4x, you're bleeding $2K/month minimum.

**Ask Next:** What's your current monthly gross margin and total admin payroll? *(ask one question at a time; store answers)*

**Data We Need:** 
- P&L statement (gross margins, admin costs)
- AR aging report
- Customer list with last purchase dates
- Owner time tracking for one week
- Vendor contract list

**Turn On Reminder:** 
- **iOS:** "Hey Siri, every Monday 8am remind me to check my $100K progress tracker"
- **Android:** "Ok Google, every Monday at 8am remind me: Review $100K treasure map"
- **Calendar:** "Title: $100K Progress Check | Mon 8am | Alert 10 min before"
