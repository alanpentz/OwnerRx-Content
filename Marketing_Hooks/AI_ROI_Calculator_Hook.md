## Full Marketing Entry Hook

---

**Hook:** You know AI is important but you're stuck at the starting line. You've tried ChatGPT a few times but don't see business impact. Meanwhile, competitors respond to customers in minutes, not hours. Start with simple automation that saves time, not complex AI that confuses.

**Why now?** The gap between AI adopters and non-adopters doubles every 6 months. Your competition is already automating what you do manually. In 12 months, catching up becomes nearly impossible.

**Problem explained in plain English:** Most business owners approach AI wrong. They try random tools, get overwhelmed, and quit. You need a systematic approach: start with highest-ROI tasks, measure everything, scale what works. No computer science degree required—just $20/month and willingness to test.

**1-Minute First Win:** Open ChatGPT right now. Paste your last customer email. Type: "Write a professional response that addresses their concerns and offers a solution." You just saved 10 minutes.

**Ask Next:** How many hours per week do you spend on repetitive tasks like email, reports, and content creation? *(Multiply by 52 weeks × your hourly rate = Your AI opportunity)*

## The ROI Calculation Framework

### Simple Measurement System

**Time Savings Calculation:**

Task Time Before AI - Task Time With AI = Time Saved
Time Saved × Frequency × Hourly Rate = Dollar Value
```

**Example: Email Response**
- Before: 10 minutes per email
- After: 2 minutes with AI
- Savings: 8 minutes each
- Frequency: 20 per day
- Daily savings: 160 minutes = 2.67 hours
- Weekly: 13.35 hours
- Annual: 694 hours × $50/hour = $34,700
