## Primary Hook Variants

## Full Marketing Entry Hook

---

**Hook:** You just lost your biggest client and realized you haven't talked to your other customers in 3 months

**Why now?** Revenue cliff approaching, pipeline bone dry, new customer acquisition taking too long, and you just remembered that selling to existing customers is 5x easier than finding new ones

**Problem explained in plain English:** You've been so busy delivering that you forgot to sell. Now your pipeline is empty, your biggest client just left, and you're 30-60 days from a cash crisis. Meanwhile, your existing customers are buying from competitors because you never asked them what else they needed. You're starving while sitting on a goldmine—your current customer list is worth $250K+ in expansion revenue, you just need the system to extract it.

**1-Minute First Win:** Pick your best customer. Text them right now: "Been thinking about your business. What's your biggest challenge this quarter?" Start the conversation that leads to expansion.

**Ask Next:** What percentage of revenue comes from your top 3 customers? *(If over 50%, you're one departure from disaster)*

**Data We Need:**
- Customer list with revenue per customer
- Last contact date with each
- Products/services they currently buy
- Products/services they don't buy
- Customer tenure/history
- Net Promoter Score or satisfaction

**Turn On Reminder:**
- **iOS:** "Hey Siri, every Monday remind me to call one customer"
- **Android:** "Ok Google, weekly reminder: Customer expansion calls"
- **Calendar:** "Customer Gold Mining Time | Wed 2-4pm | Recurring"

## The Hidden Cost of Customer Neglect

### What Ignoring Customers Really Costs

**Direct Revenue Loss:**
- Customer churn: 10-30% annually
- Competitive theft: $50K+ per lost account
- Price sensitivity: Can't raise prices
- Commoditization: Become vendor not partner
- No referrals: Lost pipeline multiplication

**Expansion Opportunity Loss:**
- Upsell potential: 30-40% revenue increase
- Cross-sell potential: 20-30% revenue increase
- Wallet share: Getting 20% when could get 60%
- Adjacent services: They buy elsewhere
- Strategic value: Tactical vendor vs. trusted advisor

**The Compound Effect:**
- Year 1: Lose 20% of customers = $200K
- Year 2: No expansion = $300K opportunity lost
- Year 3: Reputation damage = $500K impact
- Total 3-year cost: $1M+ in lost revenue

**The Shocking Math:**
- Cost to acquire new customer: $5,000-15,000
- Cost to expand existing customer: $500-1,500
- Success rate with new prospects: 5-20%
- Success rate with existing customers: 60-70%
- Profit margin on new: 10-20%
- Profit margin on expansion: 40-60%

## The 30-Day Revenue Extraction System

### Days 1-7: The Customer Gold Audit

**Day 1: The Revenue Reality Map**
Create a simple customer analyzer:
