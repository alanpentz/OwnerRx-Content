## Full Marketing Entry Hook

---

**Hook:** You're drowning in meetings that accomplish nothing. 31 hours per month in unproductive meetings—that's $399 billion wasted annually in the US alone. Here's how to eliminate 70% of them while improving communication.

**Why now?** Your calendar is packed but nothing gets done. You have meetings about meetings. The real work happens at night and weekends because your days are consumed by "collaboration."

**Problem explained in plain English:** Most meetings are information transfer disguised as collaboration. Status updates, FYIs, and "keeping everyone in the loop" steal 8+ hours weekly from actual work. The solution isn't better meetings—it's fewer meetings replaced by better async communication.

**1-Minute First Win:** Open your calendar right now. Find your next status meeting. Cancel it and send this message: "Converting to async update—will send 3-minute video summary instead."

**Ask Next:** How many hours of meetings are on your calendar this week? How many will actually make a decision? *(The gap is your opportunity)*

## The Meeting Audit Framework

### Classify Every Meeting

**Type A: Decision Meetings (KEEP)**
- Clear decision to be made
- Decision maker present
- Options pre-circulated
- 30 minutes max
- Example: "Should we launch Product X?"

**Type B: Creation Meetings (KEEP SOME)**
- Brainstorming/whiteboarding
- Real-time collaboration needed
- Creative energy required
- Limited to 3-5 people
- Example: "Design new customer experience"

**Type C: Status Updates (ELIMINATE)**
- Round-robin updates
- "What's everyone working on?"
- No decisions made
- Could be email/video
- Example: "Weekly team check-in"

**Type D: Information Transfer (ELIMINATE)**
- One-way communication
- Training/announcements
- FYI meetings
- No interaction needed
- Example: "Q3 results review"

**Type E: Relationship Building (REDUCE)**
- Team bonding
- Coffee chats
- "Face time" meetings
- Important but overdone
- Example: "Weekly 1-on-1s" → Bi-weekly

## The LOOM Async Strategy

### Replace Meetings with Video Updates

**The 3-Minute Rule:**
- 3 minutes max per update
- Show your screen
- Walk through progress
- Flag blockers
- End with next steps

**Why LOOM Works Better:**
- Record once, share with many
- Watch at 2x speed (90 seconds)
- Transcripts for searching
- Comments for clarification
- No scheduling nightmare

### Weekly LOOM Rhythm

**Monday Morning (Leader):**
- 5-minute week preview
- Priorities and focus areas
- Key decisions needed
- Calendar highlights

**Friday Afternoon (Team):**
- 3-minute individual updates
- Show actual work completed
- Flag any blockers
- Preview next week

**Result:** 2-hour meeting → 20 minutes total time

## The New Meeting Culture

### From Time Waste to Time Value

**Old Way:**
- Meetings = Productivity illusion
- Calendar full = Important person
- Default to meeting
- Sync-first thinking

**New Way:**
- Meetings = Last resort
- Calendar clear = Productive person
- Default to async
- Output-first thinking

## Decision Framework

### Should This Be a Meeting?

Ask these questions in order:

1. **Is a decision needed?** → No = Not a meeting
2. **Is the decision maker available?** → No = Not yet
3. **Are options defined?** → No = Do prep work first
4. **Will it take >15 minutes?** → No = Phone call
5. **Is real-time collaboration critical?** → No = Async

If all answers are YES → Have the meeting

## The Universal Truth

**"The amount of actual work accomplished is inversely proportional to the number of meetings attended."**

Every hour in unnecessary meetings is an hour stolen from real work. The most productive people and companies have the fewest meetings. It's not about meeting better—it's about meeting less.
