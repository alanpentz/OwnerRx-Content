## Full Marketing Entry Hook

---

**Hook:** Your business feels stuck at the same revenue level year after year. You work harder but nothing changes. The problem isn't effort—it's maturity. Most businesses die in adolescence, never reaching their prime. Take the assessment and get your 3 biggest issues to fix first (without adding more to your plate).

**Why now?** 70% of businesses plateau permanently at their current stage. They lack the systems, structure, and leadership capabilities to advance. Meanwhile, competitors who understand business maturity accelerate past them.

**Problem explained in plain English:** Every business goes through predictable life stages—from startup chaos to organizational prime. Each stage requires different systems, leadership styles, and capabilities. Most owners try to run a $5M business like a $500K startup, then wonder why everything breaks. You need to know exactly which stage you're in and what's required to advance.

**1-Minute First Win:** Answer this: Can your business run for 2 weeks without you? If not, you're stuck in the Go-Go stage, regardless of revenue. That's your first bottleneck to remove.

**Ask Next:** What worked to get you here is preventing you from getting there. What got you to $1M won't get you to $5M. Ready to identify your 3 biggest bottlenecks and get a plateau-breaking roadmap?

## The Universal Truth

**"Every business has a natural life cycle stage based on its systems and capabilities, not its age or size. A 20-year-old business can be stuck in Infancy. A 2-year-old can reach Prime."**

Maturity isn't about time in business—it's about developing the right capabilities at the right time. Most businesses die because they never develop beyond Go-Go. They work harder instead of maturing smarter.
