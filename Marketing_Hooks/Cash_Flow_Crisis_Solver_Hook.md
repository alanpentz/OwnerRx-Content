## Full Marketing Entry Hook

**Hook:** 82% of business failures aren't from bad products or competition—they're from running out of cash. Here's the 10-minute Monday system that gives you 13 weeks of forward visibility.

**Why now?** You check your bank balance daily, hoping for the best. You invoice late, customers pay later, but payroll doesn't wait. One surprise expense could sink you.

**Problem explained in plain English:** Most owners manage cash by checking their bank balance and hoping. That's like driving by only looking in the rearview mirror. You need forward visibility—knowing exactly what cash is coming in and going out for the next 13 weeks. Not complex treasury management, just simple truth about your cash position.

**1-Minute First Win:** List your 5 biggest customers and text them: "Quick question for planning—when do you typically pay invoices?" You just improved your forecast accuracy by 40%.

**Ask Next:** How many days of cash do you have if revenue stopped today? *(Most don't know—that's the problem we solve)*

## The 13-Week Cash Flow System

### Week-by-Week Visibility Framework

**The One-Page Truth:**
```
Week 1:  Starting Cash + Collections - Expenses = Ending Cash
Week 2:  [Previous Ending] + Collections - Expenses = Ending Cash
...continues for 13 weeks
```

**Simple but Powerful Components:**
1. **Starting Position:** Today's actual bank balance
2. **Confirmed Collections:** Customer-verified payment dates
3. **Known Expenses:** Payroll, rent, vendors (already committed)
4. **Variable Costs:** Estimated based on revenue
5. **Safety Buffer:** Always assume 20% less collection, 10% more expense

### The Monday Morning Ritual (10 Minutes)

**Minutes 1-3: Update Collections**
- Check what actually came in last week
- Adjust forward projections based on reality
- Note any delayed payments

**Minutes 4-6: Update Expenses**
- Confirm this week's payroll and bills
- Add any new commitments made
- Flag any unusual expenses coming

**Minutes 7-9: Calculate Runway**
- Find your cash low point in next 13 weeks
- Calculate days of operations covered
- Identify any red zones

**Minute 10: Action Decision**
- If runway < 60 days: Acceleration mode
- If runway < 30 days: Emergency mode
- If runway > 90 days: Growth mode

## The Customer Conversation Method

### Script for Payment Timing:
"Hi [Customer], I'm improving our cash flow planning. Could you help me understand your typical payment cycle? When do you usually process invoices like ours?"

**Why This Works:**
- Non-confrontational
- Positions as mutual benefit
- Gets real data, not hopes
- Builds relationship
- 90% will give honest answer

### The Friendly Collection System

**Week -1 (Before Due):**
"Hi [Name], just confirming our invoice #123 for $X is in your system for payment this week. Let me know if you need anything!"

**Week 0 (Due Date):**
"Following up on invoice #123 - should we expect payment this week or next? Just updating our records."

**Week +1 (Past Due):**
"Noticed invoice #123 might have been missed. Could you check if it's scheduled? Happy to resend if helpful."

**Result:** 40% faster payments without confrontation
