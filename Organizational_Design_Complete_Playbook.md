# Organizational Design Complete Playbook
## How to Structure Your Company for Growth Without Creating Bureaucracy

### Executive Summary: Structure Follows Strategy, Not Org Charts

Most businesses create organizational structures by copying what worked elsewhere or following theoretical models. This fails because structure must match your specific growth stage, strategy, and most importantlyâ€”where the owner's energy drains.

**Alan's Core Philosophy:** "The first layers of management come in the $2-5M range. That's when the hub and spoke model with the owner as the hub breaks down. Add managers first in the highly important areas to the company that drain the owner."

This playbook shows you how to build organizational structure that enables growth without creating bureaucratic nightmare.

## The Organizational Evolution

### The Hub and Spoke Breaking Point

**$0-$2M: Owner-Centric Model**
- Owner at center of everything
- Direct relationships with all
- Quick decisions
- Maximum flexibility
- Minimal structure

**$2-$5M: The Breaking Point**
"The hub and spoke model with the owner as the hub breaks down."

**Why It Breaks:**
- Too many direct reports
- Decision bottlenecks
- Owner overwhelm
- Quality drops
- Growth stalls

### The Management Layer Emergence

**Alan's Sequence:** "First in the highly important areas to the company that drain the owner."

**Priority Order for First Managers:**
1. Where owner energy drains most
2. Where mistakes cost most
3. Where growth potential highest
4. Where complexity increasing
5. Where talent available

**Not Based On:**
- Theoretical org charts
- What others do
- Equal distribution
- Fairness
- Seniority

## Implementation by Revenue Stage

### Solo/Bootstrap Stage ($0-$1M)
**Flat and Flexible**

**Structure Reality:**
- 3-5 people maximum
- Everyone does everything
- Titles meaningless
- Direct owner management
- Informal communication

**Organizational Principles:**
- Outcomes over roles
- Flexibility over structure
- Speed over process
- Action over planning

**Common Mistakes:**
- Creating titles too early
- Formal hierarchies
- Department silos
- Over-structuring

### Resourced Stage ($1M-$5M)
**First Structure Emerges**

**The $2-5M Transition:**
"The first layers of management come in the $2-5M range."

**Typical First Departments:**
- Sales/Revenue
- Operations/Delivery
- Finance/Admin

**First Management Roles:**
- Where owner weakest
- Where most time spent
- Where biggest problems
- Where growth blocked

**Structure Principles:**
- Clear accountability
- Defined boundaries
- Measured outcomes
- Limited layers

### Scaled Stage ($5M+)
**Professional Organization**

**The Leadership Team Requirement:**
"After $5M you need to start working towards a leader in each lane of the business. By $10-15M you should have a full leadership team."

**Organizational Components:**
- Functional departments
- Clear hierarchies
- Formal processes
- Professional managers
- Matrix elements

**Structure Evolution:**
- $5-10M: Department heads
- $10-15M: Full leadership team
- $15M+: Multiple layers

## The Energy-Based Design Principle

### Designing Around Owner Energy

**Reference Personal Vision Pillar:** "We need to reference the owner energy parts of the Personal Vision Pillar to see how to go about adding management."

### The Energy Audit Process

**Step 1: Energy Drain Mapping**

**High Energy Activities (Keep):**
- What gives you energy?
- Where do you excel?
- What do you enjoy?
- What's strategic?

**Energy Drains (Delegate First):**
- What exhausts you?
- Where do you struggle?
- What do you avoid?
- What's operational?

**Step 2: Business Impact Analysis**

Create a 2x2 Matrix:

|  | High Business Impact | Low Business Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Energizing** | Owner Focus | Delegate Eventually |
| **Draining** | Hire First | Eliminate/Automate |

**Step 3: Hiring Priority**

**First Hires:** High Impact + Draining
**Second Hires:** High Impact + Energizing (backup)
**Third Hires:** Low Impact + Draining
**Last:** Low Impact + Energizing

## Building Your First Management Layer

### Who to Promote vs. Hire

**Internal Promotion Works When:**
- Role is one level up
- Person has shown capability
- Time to learn exists
- Culture critical
- Institutional knowledge matters

**External Hiring Required When:**
- Need experience at scale
- Missing expertise entirely
- Fast growth demands
- Transformation needed
- No internal candidates

**Alan's Reality:** "You almost always have to hire outside for top roles if you are in a fast-growing company."

### Defining Management Roles

**Using Outcome-Based Definitions:**
(From Alan's job description methodology)

**Example: Operations Manager**
**Outcome:** 95% on-time delivery with <1% error rate
**Outputs Required:**
- Daily production schedules
- Quality control checks
- Team performance management
- Process documentation
- Vendor coordination
- Customer communication

**Not:** "Manage operations"

### Span of Control Guidelines

**Optimal Direct Reports:**
- Owner at $2M: 5-7 maximum
- Department heads: 5-10
- Team leads: 7-15
- Individual contributors: 0

**Factors Affecting Span:**
- Task complexity
- Employee experience
- Geographic distribution
- Interaction requirements
- Decision frequency

**Quarterly Questions:**
1. What takes too long?

5. What adds no value?

**Then:** Eliminate 20% of processes every quarter

## Alan's Final Organizational Philosophy

"Organizational structure isn't about theory or fairnessâ€”it's about what works for your specific business at your specific stage with your specific people.

The hub and spoke model works great until about $2M. Then it breaks catastrophically. You need management layers, but add them where the owner is drowning first, not where the org chart says you should.

Every time you double or triple in size, half your structure will need to change. The people who got you here won't get you there. That's not failureâ€”it's growth.

Don't copy other companies' structures. Don't create departments because it seems like you should. Don't add layers to seem more professional. Structure follows strategy, and strategy follows the owner's energy and the company's needs.

By $10-15M you need a full leadership team with a leader in each lane. But how you get there is unique to your business. Build the organization that amplifies your strengths and compensates for your weaknesses.

Remember: The best organizational structure is the one that gets things done with the least friction. Everything else is expensive bureaucracy.

Keep it as simple as possible, but no simpler. And be ready to change it when growth demands it."

**Remember:** Structure should enable growth, not constrain it. Design for where you're going, not where you've been, but implement only what you need today.
