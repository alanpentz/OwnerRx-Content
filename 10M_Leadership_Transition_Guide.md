# The $10M+ Leadership Transition Guide
*From Functional Managers to Executive Team Builders*

## Executive Summary: The Leadership Inflection Point

You've broken through $5M using the systems in our [$5M Breakthrough Playbook](/Playbooks/5M_Breakthrough_Playbook.md), but $10M represents a fundamentally different challenge. This isn't about better executionâ€”it's about building leaders who can build teams and systems without you.

**The $10M Reality:** Only 0.4% of businesses reach $10M, and 80% of those never reach $30M. The difference? Whether you build an executive team of system builders or stay trapped with a team of great performers who can't scale.

**Alan's Core Insight:** "From $10-15M, the owner needs to build out a leadership team where every member is fully qualified and able to build the systems and team under them to scale their function. Some are great performers but they can't build the team."

## The Fundamental Difference: Performers vs. Builders

### The Great Performer Trap

**What Got You Here:**
- Star salesperson who crushes quota
- Operations manager who handles everything
- Technical wizard who solves every problem
- Customer service hero who saves every account

**Why It Won't Get You There:**
- Can't replicate themselves
- Create dependency bottlenecks
- Hoard knowledge as job security
- Manage tasks, not people
- Think tactically, not strategically

### The Team Builder Profile

**What They Do Differently:**
- Build systems that work without them
- Develop people who exceed them
- Document and transfer knowledge
- Create scalable processes
- Think in terms of organizational capability

**The Litmus Test:** "If this person left tomorrow, would their department continue to improve, or would it collapse?"

### The $10M Leadership Competency Matrix

| Competency | Great Performer | Team Builder | How to Assess |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Delegation** | Does it themselves to ensure quality | Develops others to exceed their standard | Check: Who handles issues when they're out? |
| **Hiring** | Hires helpers and assistants | Hires future leaders | Check: How many of their hires got promoted? |
| **Systems** | Has personal methods | Creates documented processes | Check: Can a new hire follow their playbook? |
| **Development** | Guards expertise | Teaches and coaches constantly | Check: Who have they developed? |
| **Strategy** | Focuses on this quarter | Plans 18-24 months ahead | Check: What's their 3-year vision? |
| **Metrics** | Tracks personal performance | Builds team dashboards | Check: What leading indicators do they monitor? |

## Common Failure Patterns and Prevention

### Pattern 1: The Loyal Lieutenant Syndrome
**Problem:** Promoting your first employee to VP because they "deserve it"
**Result:** They fail, you feel guilty, the company suffers
**Prevention:** Assess capability objectively, offer alternative growth paths

### Pattern 2: The Superstar Hire Disaster
**Problem:** Hiring a big-company VP who can't operate at your scale
**Result:** Cultural rejection, over-engineering, quick departure
**Prevention:** Hire from companies 2x your size, not 10x

### Pattern 3: The Founder Bottleneck
**Problem:** All decisions still flow through you
**Result:** Organization paralyzed when you're unavailable
**Prevention:** Push decisions down, accept 80% quality for speed

### Pattern 4: The Strategy-Execution Gap
**Problem:** Great plans, poor execution
**Result:** Team confusion, missed targets, low morale
**Prevention:** Fewer priorities, better communication, clear accountability

### Pattern 5: The Culture Dilution
**Problem:** Rapid hiring without cultural integration
**Result:** Original culture lost, performance drops
**Prevention:** Slow hiring, strong onboarding, values-based decisions

## The Owner's Evolution

### From $5M to $10M (What You Did)
- Moved from doing to managing
- Built basic systems and processes
- Hired functional managers
- Created predictable revenue
- Achieved operational stability

### From $10M to $15M (What You Must Do)
- Move from managing to leading
- Build leaders who build systems
- Hire true executives
- Create scalable infrastructure
- Achieve organizational capability

### The Ultimate Test

**At $5M:** "Can the business run without me for a week?"
**At $10M:** "Can the business run without me for a month?"
**At $15M:** "Can the business improve without me?"

The answer determines whether you'll join the 0.4% who scale beyond $15M or remain stuck where 80% plateau forever.

*Remember: The difference between $10M and $15M isn't working harder or even smarterâ€”it's building leaders who can build the systems and teams that scale without you.*
