- Blockers and issues
- Sentiment and engagement
- Time allocation
- Red flags or concerns"
```

**Automation Tools:**
- Zapier + ChatGPT API
- Make.com + Claude API
- Custom Python scripts
- No-code platforms

### Weekly 1-on-1 Check-ins

## Alan's Final Remote Philosophy

"Remote work isn't about being modern or cool. It's a business decision with clear trade-offs. You get access to amazing global talent at better prices, but you need discipline to make it work.

The non-negotiables are simple: Weekly 1-on-1s with every remote employee. Daily Loom videos showing what they actually did. Feed it all into AI for analysis.

Don't overthink it. Don't over-tool it. Don't pretend it's the same as in-person. Accept the trade-offs, build the systems, and tap into the global talent pool.

Some of your best employees will be people you never meet in person. Some of your worst will be sitting in your office. Location doesn't determine performance—management systems do.

Remote works when you commit to it. It fails when you half-ass it. Choose your path and execute accordingly."

---

**Remember:** Remote isn't better or worse than in-office—it's different. Success comes from accepting the differences and building systems that work with them, not against them.
