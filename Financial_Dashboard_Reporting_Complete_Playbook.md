# Financial Dashboard & Reporting Complete Playbook
*Track Six Numbers or Die Broke*

## Executive Summary

Most business owners are driving blind—no dashboard, no metrics, no idea if they're heading toward success or disaster. They'll know they're in trouble when payroll bounces or a tax payment surprises them, but by then it's too late. The opposite extreme isn't better: complex financial reports with dozens of metrics that nobody understands or uses. The truth? You need exactly six numbers to run your business, and you need to know them "in your bones."

This playbook presents Alan's radical simplification: Start with just cash and sales. Add labor cost, gross margin, and net profit. Track marketing spend (which should be 5-10% of revenue but probably isn't). Review monthly, or weekly if cash is tight. That's your entire financial dashboard. Everything else is noise that prevents action.

The transformation ahead: From financial blindness to clarity in six numbers. From complex reports nobody reads to simple metrics that drive decisions. From hoping you'll make payroll to knowing your cash position weeks in advance. This isn't about becoming an accountant—it's about learning the language of business.

## 1. THE FINANCIAL BLINDNESS EPIDEMIC

### Why Owners Don't Track Numbers

**The Intimidation Factor**
"I'm not a numbers person." "I didn't start a business to look at spreadsheets." "My accountant handles that." These excuses mask fear—fear of not understanding, fear of bad news, fear of facing reality. So owners avoid numbers entirely, managing by gut feel and bank balance until crisis hits.

**The Complexity Trap**
When owners finally try to track metrics, they often go overboard. Dozens of KPIs, complex dashboards, detailed variance analyses. They drown in data that doesn't drive decisions. Analysis paralysis replaces ignorance, but the result is the same: no action.

**The Wrong Metrics Problem**
Many owners track what's easy instead of what matters. Website visitors instead of cash. Social media followers instead of gross margin. Employee satisfaction instead of labor efficiency. They have metrics, but not the ones that prevent failure or drive growth.

**The Accounting Theater**
Monthly P&Ls arrive from the accountant 30 days late, 40 pages long, incomprehensible. Owners nod thoughtfully in meetings, pretend to understand, file them away. The reports exist for compliance, not management. They're historical artifacts, not decision tools.

### The Cost of Financial Ignorance

**Surprise Disasters:**
- "I didn't know we were out of cash"
- "The tax payment caught us off guard"
- "We can't make payroll this week"
- "I had no idea we were losing money"

**Missed Opportunities:**
- Underpricing because you don't know true margins
- Overspending on things that don't matter
- Underspending on growth (especially marketing)
- Missing trends until competitors pass you

**Decision Paralysis:**
- Can we afford to hire?
- Should we invest in equipment?
- Is this customer profitable?
- Are we growing or dying?

Without numbers, every decision is a guess.

## 2. ALAN'S INSIGHTS: THE SIX-NUMBER REVOLUTION

### The Tracking Void

**"They usually don't track anything."**

This is the brutal reality: Most business owners track nothing. Zero metrics. No dashboard. No regular review. They manage by checking the bank balance and hoping for the best. This works until it doesn't—usually catastrophically.

The first step isn't perfection—it's starting. Any tracking beats no tracking.

### The Essential Two

**"Cash and sales."**

If you track nothing else, track these two:
- **Cash:** Will you survive the month?
- **Sales:** Are you growing or dying?

These two numbers answer the most fundamental business questions. Everything else is elaboration.

### The Core Six

**"Measure labor cost, gross margin, and net profit."**

Add these to cash and sales, plus marketing spend, and you have everything:

1. **Cash:** Your oxygen
2. **Sales/Revenue:** Your growth
3. **Gross Margin:** Your fuel
4. **Labor Cost:** Your biggest investment
5. **Net Profit:** Your reward
6. **Marketing Spend:** Your growth engine

Six numbers. That's your entire dashboard.

### The Review Rhythm

**"You can usually get away with monthly but some companies have more variability. If cash is tight track it weekly until you get a buffer and then monthly."**

Monthly is the standard rhythm—frequent enough to spot trends, not so frequent you obsess. But when cash is tight, weekly tracking becomes essential. Crisis changes the rules.

### The Marketing Reality

**"I might add marketing spend and look at it against revenue. Most companies spend too little on marketing. They should spend 5-10% of revenue there."**

The shocking truth: Most businesses underspend on marketing by 50-70%. They'll waste money on unnecessary expenses but won't invest in growth. The benchmark: 5-10% of revenue on marketing. Most spend 2-3%.

### The Dark Art of Marketing

**"It's a dark art... To paraphrase John Wanamaker, I know half my marketing budget is wasted, I just don't know which half."**

Marketing ROI is partially unknowable. Digital platforms provide some tracking, but you're mostly looking at correlations. Accept this. Experiment constantly. Track what you can, test everything, accept imperfection.

### The One Metric Rule

**"Cash."**

If you can only track one thing—if you're so overwhelmed or resistant that you'll only look at one number—make it cash. Cash is truth. Cash is survival. Everything else is commentary.

### The Transparency Balance

**"The management team should see most of the numbers but the full team only needs revenue."**

Not everyone needs every number:
- **Management Team:** Most metrics for decision-making
- **Full Team:** Revenue and specific focus metrics
- **Public:** Nothing detailed

**"Open book management... I've tried it 3 times and will never try it again."**

Full financial transparency sounds good in theory, fails in practice. Too much effort, too little understanding, too many problems.

### The Warning Signals

**"It's usually revenue or cash going down or expenses going up."**

Three trends that demand immediate action:
1. Revenue declining
2. Cash declining  
3. Expenses rising

Any of these patterns means stop what you're doing and fix it.

### Numbers as Business Language

**"Numbers are the language of business. Without them you are driving with no windshield."**

This is the fundamental truth. You can survive temporarily on gut feel, but eventually reality catches up. A surprise tax payment, a missed payroll, a cash crisis—all preventable with basic tracking.

**"Learn what they mean in your bones."**

Don't just track numbers—internalize them. Know what normal looks like. Feel when something's off. Develop numerical intuition through repetition.

**The Hierarchy of Metrics:**
- **Revenue:** "Your vanity metric. You want it to go up but it doesn't mean that much."
- **Gross Margin:** "That's the fuel for the business."
- **Labor:** "Your biggest investment. How many dollars of revenue are you getting for every dollar of labor?"
- **Profit:** "Are we getting a real return on this business?"
- **Cash:** "It's oxygen or blood to the business."

## 3. THE PROGRESSIVE DASHBOARD SYSTEM

### Level 1: The Survival Dashboard (Start Here)

**For Whom:** Every business owner who tracks nothing

**The Only Two Numbers:**
```
DAILY SURVIVAL CHECK:
1. Cash in Bank: $_______
2. Sales This Month: $_______

Time Required: 2 minutes
Frequency: Daily until habitual
```

**How to Track:**
- Open banking app: Check balance
- Quick sales count: Orders, customers, or revenue
- Write it down: Notebook, spreadsheet, or napkin
- Watch the trend: Up, down, or flat?

**Why These Two:**
- Cash tells you if you'll survive
- Sales tells you if you're growing
- Together they prevent surprises
- Simple enough to actually do

**Success Criteria:**
- Track daily for 30 days
- See patterns emerge
- Develop cash comfort zone
- Notice sales rhythms

### Level 2: The Operating Dashboard (Add After 3 Months)

**For Whom:** Owners comfortable with basic tracking

### Alan's Final Dashboard Wisdom

**"Look at your numbers every month. We are talking about 6 or so. Learn what they mean in your bones."**

Six numbers. Not sixty. Not six hundred. Six. That's the revolutionary simplification. Most businesses are run on thousands of metrics nobody understands or millions of gut feelings that mislead. You need six numbers you know deeply.

**The Hierarchy to Remember:**
- **Cash:** Oxygen—without it, you die
- **Revenue:** Vanity—nice but not sufficient
- **Gross Margin:** Fuel—powers everything else
- **Labor:** Investment—biggest lever for return
- **Profit:** Reward—why you're in business
- **Marketing:** Growth—usually underfunded by 50%

### The Ultimate Dashboard Truth

Perfect information that's never reviewed is worthless. Simple metrics tracked consistently transform businesses. The difference between successful businesses and failures isn't the sophistication of their financial systems—it's whether they look at basic numbers regularly.

You don't need an MBA. You don't need complex software. You don't need a CFO. You need six numbers, monthly discipline, and the courage to face reality.

Most owners track nothing because they're afraid of what they'll find. But ignorance isn't bliss—it's a ticking bomb. That tax payment, that payroll crisis, that cash crunch—all predictable with basic tracking.

Start with two numbers. Add four more. Review monthly. Learn them in your bones. Let them guide your decisions. Watch your business transform from reactive scrambling to proactive management.

Remember: You can fake a lot of things in business, but you can't fake cash. You can't fake profit. You can't fake the math. The numbers will tell you the truth if you're willing to listen.

The question isn't whether you're a "numbers person." The question is whether you want to survive and thrive, or guess and hope.

Six numbers. Monthly review. Learned in your bones.

That's not accounting. That's survival. That's growth. That's the language of business.

Start speaking it today.
