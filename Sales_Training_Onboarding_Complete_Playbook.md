# Sales Training & Onboarding Complete Playbook
## Turn Average People Into Revenue Machines

### Executive Summary: Great Salespeople Are Made, Not Born

Most businesses hire salespeople and throw them into the deep end, hoping natural talent will prevail. This is why 87% of sales reps fail in their first year. The difference between sales teams that consistently hit quota and those that don't isn't talent—it's training.

**Alan's Core Philosophy:** "I've hired 'natural' salespeople who failed and 'average' people who became top performers. The difference was onboarding and training. Give me someone with work ethic and coachability over talent any day. I can teach them to sell; I can't teach them to care."

This playbook shows you how to build systematic training and onboarding that transforms ordinary people into extraordinary salespeople.

## The Training Reality

### Why Sales Training Fails

#### The "They Should Know" Assumption
**The Mistake:** Assuming experienced reps need no training
**The Reality:** Your way is different than their last company
**Alan's Truth:** "Even 20-year veterans need to learn YOUR way"

#### The Information Dump
**The Problem:** 40 hours of content in week one
**The Result:** Overwhelm, poor retention, slow ramp
**The Solution:** Gradual release, applied learning

#### The "One and Done" Approach
**The Problem:** Initial training then nothing
**The Reality:** Skills decay without reinforcement
**The Fix:** Continuous learning culture

### The Cost of Poor Onboarding

**Financial Impact:**
- Failed rep cost: $75-200K
- Extended ramp time: $50K per month
- Lost deals during learning: $100K+
- Team morale impact: Priceless
- Customer experience damage: Unmeasurable

**Time Impact:**
- Average ramp time: 6-9 months
- With great training: 3-4 months
- Difference: 3-5 months of productivity

## Alan's Final Training Wisdom

"Most companies hire for experience then wonder why experienced reps fail. They fail because every company sells differently, and without proper training, they're using someone else's playbook in your game.

I learned this expensive lesson: A hungry beginner with great training beats a lazy veteran with no training every time. Hire for attitude and aptitude, then train the hell out of them.

Your onboarding program is your competitive advantage. While competitors throw people into the deep end, you're building swimming champions. By the time their reps figure it out, yours are already closing deals.

Here's the formula: Week one is foundation, week two is process, week three is practice, week four is performance. By day 30, they should be dangerous. By day 60, productive. By day 90, profitable.

Don't skimp on training to save time. Every week you cut from training adds a month to ramp time. Do the math—proper training pays for itself in the first deal.

Create a culture of continuous learning. Your best reps should be teaching your new reps. Your new reps should be hungry to learn. Everyone should be getting better every week.

Finally, remember that training isn't an event—it's a process. The day your salespeople stop learning is the day your competition starts winning.

Invest in training like your growth depends on it. Because it does."

**Remember:** Great salespeople aren't born, they're trained. Invest in training or pay for turnover.
