# Leadership Development Complete Playbook
## Why Most Internal Leadership Development Fails (And What Actually Works)

### Executive Summary: Companies Grow Faster Than People

The hard truth about leadership development: your company will outgrow most of your people. The person who was perfect at $2M becomes a bottleneck at $10M. That's why you need to hire leaders externally for key roles while building systems that help good people grow one level up.

**Alan's Core Philosophy:** "You almost always have to hire outside for top roles if you are in a fast-growing company. The people in the company can't grow quickly enough except for a few exceptional people. Companies can grow faster than people."

This playbook shows you how to identify potential, develop who you can, and know when to hire from outside.

## The Leadership Development Reality

### Why Internal Development Usually Fails

**The Growth Mismatch:**
"Companies can grow faster than people. The firefighter jack of all trades who was awesome when things got crazy at $2-3M isn't the best sales director or COO at $10M."

**The Competency Gap:**
- $2M skills ≠ $10M skills
- Complexity increases exponentially
- Market demands change
- Competition intensifies
- Scale requires different thinking

### When to Develop vs. Hire

**Develop Internally When:**
- Growing steadily (20-30% annually)
- One level promotion only
- Time to learn (6-12 months)
- Strong foundation exists
- Cultural fit critical

**Hire Externally When:**
- Growing fast (50%+ annually)
- Need senior leadership
- Missing critical expertise
- Time pressure exists
- Transformation required

**Alan's Rule:** "Most people can do a role right above them after being in a role below for a while but skipping ahead up the ladder too far is a disaster waiting to happen."

## Alan's Final Leadership Philosophy

"Here's the truth about leadership development: No training program is going to be perfect. Most are rarely very good or effective. Every company starts out with great ideas about training but reality hits.

In a growing company, you don't have time to develop everyone. Companies grow faster than people. That person who was perfect at $2M will likely fail at $10M. It's not their fault—it's just reality.

That's why I usually hire from outside for senior roles. You need people who've been there before, who know what $10M or $20M looks like.

For internal people, use AI to build playbooks that give them the processes and templates they need. Let smart employees find mentors organically—forced mentoring never works. Promote one level at a time and see if they sink or swim.

Most will sink. That's okay. Better to know quickly than pretend otherwise.

Remember: Every time you double or triple in size, plan to replace half your leadership team. It sounds harsh, but it's the reality of growth. The alternative is letting the wrong people in the wrong roles kill your company.

Build the leadership team your future needs, not the one your past earned."

**Remember:** Leadership development is about preparing for tomorrow's needs, not rewarding yesterday's performance. Most people have a ceiling. Find it quickly and plan accordingly.
