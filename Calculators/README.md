# OwnerRx Business Calculators

## Overview
Five high-impact business calculators built from Alan Pentz's real-world insights and the OwnerRx framework. Each calculator transforms complex business concepts into simple, actionable metrics.

## Calculators

### 1. Labor Efficiency Ratio Calculator
- **Purpose**: Determine if you're making money on your team or just trading dollars
- **Key Metric**: Revenue รท Total Labor Cost
- **Target**: 2.0+ for profitability, 3.0+ for excellence
- **Based On**: Greg Crabtree's framework, emphasized by Alan

### 2. 4 Napkin Metrics Dashboard
- **Purpose**: Track only what matters - nothing more
- **Metrics**: Cash (runway), Gross Margin, Labor Efficiency, Net Profit
- **Philosophy**: "If you can't calculate it on a napkin, it's too complicated"
- **Frequency**: Cash daily, others monthly

### 3. $10 vs $10,000 Hour Task Analyzer
- **Purpose**: Calculate opportunity cost of doing low-value work
- **Key Insight**: Every hour on $20 work costs you $10,000 in lost opportunity
- **Output**: ROI on delegation, priority tasks to delegate
- **Based On**: Alan's Zone of Genius concept

### 4. Business Valuation Reality Check
- **Purpose**: Reality-based business valuation (not wishful thinking)
- **Key Truth**: 80% of small businesses are worth zero to a buyer
- **Factors**: Owner dependence, customer concentration, recurring revenue
- **Output**: Realistic valuation range and improvement actions

### 5. Customer Concentration Risk Tool
- **Purpose**: Measure your single point of failure risk
- **Key Rule**: No customer over 20%, top 3 under 50%, need 20+ for 80% revenue
- **Risk Levels**: Critical (30%+), High (20-30%), Moderate (15-20%), Low (<15%)
- **Based On**: Alan's "Victory has 1000 fathers" principle
