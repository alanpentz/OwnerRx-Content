# Sales Hiring & Management Complete Playbook
## The Brutal Truth About When You Can Actually Afford Sales Talent

### Executive Summary: Stop Hiring Salespeople Too Early

Here's the truth most business owners refuse to accept: **You cannot afford a real salesperson until you're doing $5-10M in revenue.** Period.

The fantasy that hiring a salesperson will magically grow your business is exactly that - a fantasy that burns cash and destroys momentum. The reality is harsh but liberating once you accept it:

- **$0-$5M:** You ARE the salesperson. Hire support, not sellers.
- **$5-10M:** You MIGHT be able to afford your first real salesperson.
- **$10M+:** You need a sales system architect, not just another seller.

This playbook will save you from the most expensive hiring mistake small businesses make: hiring salespeople before you can afford them or before you need them.

## The Revenue Reality Check: When You Can Actually Afford Salespeople

### The $5M Rule: Why It Exists

"Owners need to be the main salespeople until the company gets well past $5M."

This isn't arbitrary. Here's the math:
- Good salesperson salary: $150K-$300K+ (base + commission)
- Benefits and overhead: Add 30-50%
- Total cost: $200K-$450K annually
- Revenue needed to justify: $2-4.5M (assuming 10% net margin)

But cost isn't the only issue. At under $5M, you need someone who can:
- Understand the product intimately
- Make pricing decisions on the fly
- Modify the offering based on client needs
- Take feedback and implement changes immediately

Only the owner can do this effectively at early stages.

### The Talent Reality

"It's hard to find incredible salespeople... Those people exist but they get paid $2M a year and work for Oracle."

The salespeople you can afford at $2M revenue aren't the ones who can actually drive meaningful growth. You're stuck with:
- Junior reps who need extensive training
- B-players who couldn't make it elsewhere
- Cowboys who promise the world but deliver nothing

Meanwhile, the A-players who could actually move the needle are:
- Making $500K-$2M at enterprise companies
- Working with established products and proven systems
- Not interested in your startup salary and equity gamble

### The Bootstrapped Business Truth

"In a bootstrapped business you can't afford a real salesperson until you are over $5M in revenue and probably closer to $10M."

Without VC money, every hire has to pay for itself immediately. A $300K salesperson needs to generate $3M+ in additional revenue just to break even after taxes and overhead. At early stages, that's often impossible because:

- The sales cycle is still being refined
- The product-market fit isn't perfect
- The pricing model is evolving
- The ideal customer profile is unclear

**VC Exception:** If you have investor money, you can hire experienced sales managers earlier. But even then, focus on system builders, not just sellers.

## What to Hire Instead of Salespeople: The Support Strategy

### Sales Support Roles That Actually Work

Instead of hiring expensive salespeople you can't afford, hire support that amplifies YOUR sales efforts:

**Lead Generation Specialist ($40-60K)**
- Cold outreach campaigns
- List building and research
- Initial qualification calls
- Appointment setting

**Sales Operations Coordinator ($45-65K)**
- CRM management and cleanup
- Proposal creation and follow-up
- Contract management
- Pipeline reporting

**Customer Success/Account Manager ($50-70K)**
- Existing client expansion
- Renewal conversations
- Testimonial and referral generation
- Product usage optimization

**Marketing Coordinator ($40-55K)**
- Content creation for sales enablement
- Social media management
- Event coordination
- Lead nurturing campaigns

### The Owner + Support Model

"You can hire sales support so that all you do is talk with good prospects."

This is the sweet spot for $1-5M businesses:

**Your Role:** High-value activities only
- Discovery calls with qualified prospects
- Demos and presentations
- Negotiation and closing
- Strategic account planning

**Support Team Role:** Everything else
- Lead generation and qualification
- Administrative tasks
- Follow-up and nurturing
- System maintenance

**Total Cost:** $100-200K vs. $300-500K for a salesperson
**Result:** Better outcomes because you're still the closer

- Systematize outreach

## The Sales Architect vs. Salesperson Distinction

### What You DON'T Need: Just Another Seller

Most businesses hire individual contributors when they need system builders. A salesperson can only scale themselves. A sales architect scales the entire organization.

### What You DO Need: A System Builder

"As you get bigger, the job goes from being a sales person to being a sales manager who can architect a sales system."

**Sales Architect Capabilities:**
- Territory planning and segmentation
- Compensation plan design
- Sales process documentation
- Training program development
- Performance management systems
- Pipeline forecasting and analysis
- Tool selection and implementation

**Track Record to Look For:**
- Built sales systems from scratch
- Managed teams of 5+ salespeople
- Scaled revenue from $10M to $50M+
- Experience at your stage and industry

### The Internal Promotion Trap

"Don't promote from within because those people don't know how to build a sales system and neither do you. It's the blind leading the dumb."

**Why Internal Promotion Fails:**
- No external sales system experience
- Limited perspective on best practices
- Lack of formal sales management training
- Too close to existing problems to see solutions

**When Internal Promotion Works:**
- Person has external sales management experience
- You can afford external sales consultants
- The role is clearly defined as learning/transitional

---

## Finding and Evaluating Sales Talent

### Where to Look

**For Sales Architects ($10M+ stage):**
- Companies that scaled from $10-100M
- Similar industry/business model
- Recently acquired companies (talent often available)
- Professional sales networks

**Red Flags:**
- Only experience at large enterprises ($100M+)
- No system-building experience
- Industry hoppers with short tenures
- Promises immediate results without seeing your business

### Evaluation Framework

**Systems Experience (60% weight)**
- "Walk me through how you built a sales process from scratch"
- "What CRM implementations have you led?"
- "How do you design compensation plans?"
- "Describe your approach to sales forecasting"

**Cultural Fit (25% weight)**
- Ability to work in entrepreneurial environment
- Comfort with ambiguity and change
- Hands-on mentality
- Coachable and collaborative

**Results (15% weight)**
- Revenue growth at previous companies
- Team performance improvements
- System implementation success
- Reference checks with former colleagues

### The Interview Process

**Round 1: Systems Thinking**
- Present a sales challenge from your business
- Ask them to design a solution
- Focus on process, not just tactics

**Round 2: Culture Assessment**
- Meet the team they'd work with
- Observe interaction style
- Test problem-solving approach

**Round 3: Reference Deep Dive**
- Speak with former direct reports
- Validate system-building claims
- Understand management style

## Compensation Structures That Work

### The Owner-Seller Stage ($0-5M)
**Your compensation:** Business ownership and profit
**Support team:** Fixed salaries, performance bonuses

### The First Salesperson Stage ($5-10M)
**Base + Commission Model:**
- Base: $80-120K (enough to live on)
- Commission: 3-8% of new revenue
- Cap: None, but reset annually
- Quota: 3-5x base salary in new revenue

### The Sales System Stage ($10M+)
**Sales Manager/Director:**
- Base: $150-250K
- Bonus: Based on team performance and system metrics
- Equity: 0.5-2% vesting over 4 years
- Override: 1-3% on team production

**Individual Contributors:**
- Base: $60-100K
- Commission: 5-12% depending on product/cycle
- Accelerators: Higher rates above quota
- Benefits: Standard package competitive with market

### Compensation Design Principles

1. **Align with business model:** Higher base for longer sales cycles
2. **Reward the right behaviors:** Commission structure should drive desired activities
3. **Keep it simple:** Complex plans confuse and demotivate
4. **Regular review:** Adjust based on results and market changes
