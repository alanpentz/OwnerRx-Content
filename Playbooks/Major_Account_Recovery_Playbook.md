# Major Account Recovery Playbook
*How to save relationships worth 20%+ of your revenue*

## Overview
Losing a major account is predictable and preventable. This playbook provides the systematic approach to identify at-risk accounts, understand the real problems, and execute recovery before it's too late.

---

## The Universal Truth
**"Major customer loss is always predictable, just ignored."**

The warning signs are always there:
- Order frequency declining
- Longer payment cycles
- Less responsive to communication
- New stakeholders you don't know
- Complaints becoming more frequent
- Competitor mentions increasing

---

## The Account Decline Pattern

### How Major Accounts Die

**Month 1-2: The Subtle Shift**
- 10-15% order reduction
- "Budget constraints" mentioned
- Response time slowing
- Your champion less engaged

**Month 3-4: The Distancing**
- 20-30% order reduction
- New decision makers appear
- Excuses replace explanations
- Competitor products visible

**Month 5-6: The Crisis**
- 40%+ order reduction
- Direct conversation avoided
- Contracts not renewed
- Relationship effectively over

**The Reality:** By month 4, you've already lost unless you act aggressively

---

## The Early Warning System

### Red Flags Requiring Immediate Action

**Quantitative Signals (Any One Triggers Response):**
- Order volume down >10% for 2 months
- Order frequency reduced by 25%
- Payment terms extended without request
- Contract renewal <90 days without discussion
- Support tickets up 50%

**Qualitative Signals (Two or More = Alert):**
- Champion stops returning calls quickly
- New stakeholders you haven't met
- "We're evaluating options"
- Quality complaints increase
- Strategic initiatives not shared
- Your ideas politely declined

**The Rule:** At first signal, launch recovery protocol. Don't wait for confirmation.

## The Account Recovery Protocol

### Your 6-8 Week Sprint to Save the Relationship

## Week 1: Intelligence Gathering

### Step 1: The Stakeholder Map
Create a visual diagram of everyone involved:

**Identify:**
- **Economic Buyer:** Who controls budget?
- **Technical Buyer:** Who evaluates functionality?
- **User Buyer:** Who actually uses your product?
- **Champion:** Who advocates for you internally?
- **Saboteur:** Who prefers your competitor?
- **Influencers:** Who do decision makers listen to?

**For Each Person, Document:**
- Name and title
- How long in role
- Personal win criteria
- Relationship strength (1-10)
- Last interaction date
- Their biggest concern

### Step 2: The Problem Diagnosis

**Internal Investigation:**
- Review all support tickets last 6 months
- Analyze order patterns and changes
- Check contract terms and pricing history
- Review all email communications
- Document service failures

**External Investigation:**
- LinkedIn research on all stakeholders
- Industry news about customer
- Competitor activity analysis
- Regulatory or market changes
- Their customer reviews/feedback

### Step 3: The Hypothesis Development

Based on investigation, identify likely causes:
- Price became uncompetitive
- Service quality declined
- Competitor offered better solution
- Internal champion left or lost influence
