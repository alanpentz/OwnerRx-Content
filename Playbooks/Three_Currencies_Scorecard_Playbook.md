# The Three Currencies Scorecard Playbook
*Track and optimize the three forms of business value creation*

## Overview
Every business gets paid in three currencies, not just revenue. Most only track money, missing two-thirds of their value creation. This playbook helps you measure and optimize all three currencies that compound into sustainable success.

## The Three Currencies Framework

### Currency 1: Gross Margin (Immediate Value)
- **What It Is:** The gap between your cost and customer's willingness to pay
- **Why It Matters:** Best measure of value creation
- **Decay Rate:** Can disappear overnight

### Currency 2: Knowledge Compounding (Expertise Value)
- **What It Is:** Accumulated expertise from solving problems
- **Why It Matters:** Creates competitive moat
- **Decay Rate:** Slowest to erode

### Currency 3: Reputation (Trust Value)
- **What It Is:** Market perception and trust
- **Why It Matters:** Reduces sales friction, commands premium
- **Decay Rate:** Can evaporate instantly with one mistake

**The Multiplication Effect:** All three currencies reinforce each other, creating exponential value when aligned.
