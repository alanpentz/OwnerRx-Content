# Customer Concentration Risk Reduction Playbook

## The Single Point of Failure That Kills Businesses

*"Victory has 1000 fathers, defeat is an orphan. When one customer is 30% of revenue, they own you. They know it, you know it, and any buyer will run away."* - Alan Pentz

## INSTANT ASSESSMENT

Answer these three questions:
1. What percentage of revenue is your largest customer? ____%
2. What percentage are your top 3 customers combined? ____%
3. How many customers to reach 80% of revenue? ____ customers

**Your Risk Level:**
- Largest customer >30% = CRITICAL (Business failure risk)
- Largest customer 20-30% = HIGH (Unsellable business)
- Largest customer 15-20% = MODERATE (Growth constrained)
- Largest customer <15% = LOW (Healthy diversification)

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH

### What Customer Concentration Really Means

**If your biggest customer is 30%+ of revenue:**
- They control your pricing (and know it)
- They dictate your priorities
- Your business is worth 50% less to buyers
- One phone call can end your business
- You're not a business owner, you're their employee

**Alan's Reality Check:** "I've seen it 100 times. The big customer squeezes margins, demands everything, then leaves for someone 5% cheaper. The business dies in 90 days."

### The 20/50/80 Rule

The only metrics that matter:
- **No single customer over 20%**
- **Top 3 customers under 50%**
- **Need 20+ customers for 80% of revenue**

Break these rules and you have a job, not a business.

## PHASE 1: STOP THE BLEEDING (Days 1-7)

### Day 1: Face Reality
**Morning:**
- List all customers and their last 12 months revenue
- Calculate exact percentages
- Identify your concentration risk

**Afternoon:**
- Call your insurance broker about key person/customer insurance
- Document what happens if top customer leaves today
- Calculate months of survival without them

**Alan's Script for Your Team:**
"We have a concentration problem. [Customer] is [X]% of our revenue. Starting today, we're fixing this or we won't have a business in 12 months."

### Day 2-3: Implement Customer Caps

**The Cap Policy (Non-Negotiable):**
```
Effective immediately:
- No customer can exceed 20% of revenue
- Any customer over 20% goes on allocation
- New business priority goes to smaller customers
- No exceptions, including current top customer
```

**How to Communicate to Large Customer:**
"We're experiencing incredible demand and need to manage capacity. We'll maintain your current service level, but new projects may have extended timelines."

Never say: "You're too big for us." They'll leave immediately.

### Day 4-5: Document the Relationship

**Create a "Customer Divorce Plan":**
- Every process they touch
- Every customization made for them
- All tribal knowledge about their needs
- Key contacts and relationships
- Contract terms and exit clauses
- Historical issues and resolutions

**Why:** When (not if) they leave, you'll need this to survive or sell.

### Day 6-7: Launch Emergency Diversification

**The 10-10-10 Sprint:**
- 10 calls to dormant customers
- 10 emails to lost proposals
- 10 reaches to referral sources

**The 9-Word Email That Works:**
"Are you still looking for [what you do]?"

Send to everyone who didn't buy in the last 2 years.

## PHASE 2: BUILD THE FOUNDATION (Days 8-30)

### Week 2: Customer Acquisition Blitz

**The "Clone Your Best Customer" Strategy:**

1. **Identify Your Best Non-Dominant Customer**
   - 5-15% of revenue
   - Pays on time
   - Values what you do
   - Reasonable demands

2. **Find 100 More Like Them**
   - Same industry
   - Same size
   - Same geography
   - Same problems

3. **The Outreach Campaign**
   ```
   Subject: [Competitor] recommended I reach out
   
   Hi [Name],
   
   We help [similar companies] with [specific problem].
   [Best customer] saw [specific result].
   
   Worth a brief call to explore if we can help you too?
   
   [Your name]
   ```

**Daily Minimums:**
- 20 prospecting touches
- 5 meaningful conversations
- 2 proposals/quotes
- 1 new customer per week

### Week 3: Pricing Power Recovery

**The Truth:** Your big customer has destroyed your margins.

**The Fix:**
1. Calculate true margin on top customer (it's negative)
2. Set new customer pricing 20% higher minimum
3. Test 30% higher on smallest opportunities
4. Document every discount request
5. Stop negotiating against yourself

**Alan's Rule:** "New customers pay full price or they don't buy. Period."

### Week 4: Diversification Infrastructure

**Build These Systems:**

1. **CRM Segmentation**
   - Tag all customers by revenue percentage
   - Alert when approaching 15%
   - Track concentration trend monthly

2. **The Weekly Concentration Review**
   Every Monday:
   - Update customer percentages
   - Review pipeline by customer
   - Adjust focus based on caps
   - Celebrate diversification wins

3. **The "No Heroes" Policy**
   - No single salesperson owns >30% of revenue
   - No single customer gets dedicated resources
   - No custom processes for one customer
   - No exceptions to standard terms

## PHASE 3: SYSTEMATIC DIVERSIFICATION (Days 31-90)

### Month 2: Channel Diversification

**Current State:** One customer = one channel

**Future State:** Multiple channels, no concentration

**The Channel Priority Matrix:**
1. **Keep:** Current channel minus dominant customer
2. **Add One:** Most similar to current success

4. **Never:** Don't chase enterprise if you're SMB

**Example Progression:**
- Month 2: Add industry-specific trade shows
- Month 3: Launch targeted LinkedIn campaign
- Month 4: Build partner referral program

### Month 3: Product/Service Expansion

**The Adjacent Possible Strategy:**

What can you sell to existing (non-dominant) customers?
- Additional services they're buying elsewhere
- Products that complement current offering
- Subscription/recurring version of one-time sale
- Training/consulting on top of delivery

**The Test:**
- Week 1: Ask 10 customers what else they need
- Week 2: Create simple version of top request
- Week 3: Sell to 3 customers as pilot
- Week 4: Refine and roll out

### The 90-Day Targets

**Minimum Acceptable Progress:**
- Largest customer under 25% (from whatever it was)
- Added 10+ new customers
- Launched one new channel
- Increased average price 10%
- Documented all customer dependencies

**Stretch Goals:**
- Largest customer under 20%

### The Customer Cap Conversation

**When they want more than 20%:**

"We've learned that maintaining service quality requires us to balance our customer portfolio. We can absolutely maintain your current level, and we'd be happy to recommend trusted partners for additional capacity."

**When they threaten to leave:**

"We value our relationship and want to maintain the quality you expect. If you need significantly more capacity, let's discuss a phased approach that works for both of us."

**When they demand exclusivity:**

"Our ability to serve you well depends on maintaining a healthy business. Diversification ensures we're here for the long term and can continue investing in capabilities that benefit you."

## ALAN'S WISDOM

### The Psychology of Concentration

"Owners get addicted to the big check. It feels safe. It's actually the riskiest position possible. You're not a business owner - you're a highly paid employee with no employment protection."

### The Liberation Effect

"The day you tell a dominant customer 'no' for the first time, you become a real business owner. The fear disappears. The clarity is incredible."

### The Valuation Reality

"Show me a business with one customer at 40% of revenue, I'll show you a business worth zero. Fix the concentration, the value triples overnight."

### The Ultimate Test

"If your biggest customer called tomorrow and fired you, would you thank them? If not, you're concentrated. Period."

Start today. The business you save will be your own.
