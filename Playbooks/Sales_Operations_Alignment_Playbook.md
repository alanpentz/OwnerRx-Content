# Sales-Operations Alignment Playbook
*How to prevent sales success from breaking your business*

## Overview
The fastest way to destroy a growing business is to scale sales without preparing operations. This playbook shows you how to align sales growth with operational capacity, ensuring every new customer becomes a success story, not a service nightmare.

---

## The Universal Truth
**"Great sales with broken operations equals customer loss and brand damage."**

Every failed growth story follows the same pattern:
- Sales team crushes their targets
- Operations gets overwhelmed
- Quality drops, errors multiply
- Customers complain and leave
- Growth becomes decline

## The Sales-Operations Death Spiral

### How Success Becomes Failure

**Month 1: The Sales Victory**
- New sales strategy working
- Leads up 40%
- Pipeline growing fast
- Team celebrating wins
- "We're crushing it!"

**Month 2: The Operations Strain**
- Can't quote fast enough
- Errors increasing
- Overtime becoming normal
- Quality starting to slip
- "We need more people!"

**Month 3: The Customer Revolt**
- Delivery delays mounting
- Complaints increasing
- Returns/refunds rising
- Reviews turning negative
- "What happened to service?"

**Month 4: The Crisis**
- Key customers leaving
- Team burning out
- Reputation damaged
- Sales grinding to halt
- Emergency mode

**The Math:**
- 40% sales increase → 200% operations stress
- 1 week delivery → 3 week delays
- 2% error rate → 10% error rate
- 9/10 satisfaction → 6/10 satisfaction

2. Automate everything possible
3. Scale sales to 100% capacity
4. Monitor and adjust
5. Repeat

**Remember:** It's better to turn away business than to damage your reputation with poor delivery.
