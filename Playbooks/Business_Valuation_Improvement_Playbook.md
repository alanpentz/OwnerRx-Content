## From Worthless to Sellable: Triple Your Business Value in 12 Months

*"80% of small businesses are worth zero to a buyer. Not because they don't make money, but because they're not businesses - they're jobs with extra steps."* - Alan Pentz

---

## THE VALUATION REALITY CHECK

**Take this 60-second assessment:**

1. Could your business run for 3 months without you? (Y/N)
2. Is your largest customer less than 20% of revenue? (Y/N)
3. Do you have documented processes for everything? (Y/N)
4. Is your management team capable of running things? (Y/N)
5. Do you have 50%+ recurring/repeat revenue? (Y/N)
6. Are your financials clean and accurate? (Y/N)
7. Have you grown 20%+ annually for 3 years? (Y/N)
8. Do you have 6+ months cash reserves? (Y/N)
9. Is your EBITDA margin over 20%? (Y/N)
10. Could a stranger understand your business in 1 hour? (Y/N)

**Your Score:**
- 0-3 Yes: Your business is worth $0-1x profit
- 4-6 Yes: Your business is worth 1-2x profit
- 7-8 Yes: Your business is worth 2-3x profit
- 9-10 Yes: Your business is worth 3-5x+ profit

**If you scored under 7, you don't have a sellable business.**

## THE VALUATION FORMULA

### What Buyers Actually Pay For

**The Simple Math:**
Business Value = EBITDA × Multiple × (1 - Risk Discount)

**EBITDA** = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization
**Multiple** = Industry standard (usually 2-4x for small business)
**Risk Discount** = How much they reduce for problems (often 50%+)

### The Multiple Makers & Breakers

**Multiple Enhancers (+0.5-1x each):**
- Owner not required (+1x)
- Growing 30%+ yearly (+1x)
- Recurring revenue 70%+ (+1x)
- Clean documented systems (+0.5x)
- Strong management team (+0.5x)
- Diversified customer base (+0.5x)

**Multiple Destroyers (-0.5-2x each):**
- Owner is the business (-2x)
- Customer concentration (-1x)
- Declining revenue (-1x)
- No systems or process (-0.5x)
- Key person dependencies (-0.5x)
- Messy financials (-0.5x)

## ALAN'S VALUATION WISDOM

### On Owner Dependency
"The ultimate test: Take a 3-month vacation. If the business grows while you're gone, it's worth 5x. If it survives, 3x. If it dies, 0x."

### On Financial Engineering
"Buyers don't care about your tax strategies. They care about clean, predictable, growing cash flow. Stop being clever, start being clear."

### On Growth
"A business growing 30% is worth double one growing 10%, even with the same profit. Growth forgives many sins."

### On Systems
"Document like you're going to jail tomorrow and someone else has to run everything. Because that's essentially what selling means."

### On The Ultimate Truth
"You're not selling a business. You're selling a machine that prints money without you. Build the machine, the buyers will come."

## FINAL TRUTH

Every business is eventually sold, transferred, or shut down. The only question is whether you'll get paid millions or walk away with nothing.

The difference isn't the business you're in - it's the business you build.

Start building a sellable business today, even if you never plan to sell. Because a sellable business is a valuable business, and a valuable business is one worth owning.

*"Build your business like you're selling it tomorrow, run it like you'll own it forever. That's how fortunes are made."* - Alan Pentz
