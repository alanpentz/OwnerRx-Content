# The Difficult Conversations Playbook
*How to address the elephants that are killing your business*

## Overview
Most business problems persist not because they're unsolvable, but because they're uncomfortable to discuss. This playbook gives you the framework and permission to have the conversations that matter.

## The Universal Truth
**"Your biggest problem is usually the one nobody wants to discuss."**

Every failing business has at least one elephant in the room:
- The underperforming family member
- The major customer that's leaving
- The broken process everyone works around
- The toxic high performer
- The strategy that isn't working

## The Elephant in the Room Protocol

### How to Surface What Everyone's Thinking

**Step 1: The Anonymous Survey**
Before the meeting, ask everyone:
- "What's the one issue we keep discussing but never resolve?"
- "What conversation are we avoiding that we need to have?"
- "If you were CEO for a day, what would you fix first?"

**Step 2: The Meeting Setup**
- Schedule 90 minutes minimum
- No phones, no distractions
- Everyone must attend
- Start with: "We're here to solve, not discuss"

**Step 3: The Naming Process**
1. Share survey results
2. Ask: "What's our biggest unsolved problem?"
3. Write all answers visibly
4. Vote on top 3
5. Pick #1 to solve TODAY

**Step 4: The Resolution Requirement**
- No one leaves until there's a resolution
- Resolution must have:
  - Specific actions
  - Named owner
  - Timeline
  - Success metrics
  - Check-in schedule

## The Five Difficult Conversations Framework

### 1. The Performance Conversation
**When someone isn't delivering**

**The Setup:**
"I need to discuss your performance in [specific area]. This is important for both of us."

**The Framework:**
- **Situation:** Here's what I'm observing...
- **Impact:** Here's how it affects the business...
- **Expectation:** Here's what needs to happen...
- **Support:** Here's how I can help...
- **Consequence:** Here's what happens if it doesn't change...

**The Close:**
"Do you understand what needs to change? What support do you need? When will I see improvement?"

### 2. The Customer Loss Conversation
**When a major customer is leaving or reducing orders**

**The Setup:**
"We're seeing a 40% decline in your orders. I need to understand what's happening so we can fix it."

**The Framework:**
- **Acknowledge:** "You're important to us..."
- **Investigate:** "What's changed on your end?"
- **Listen:** (Actually listen, don't defend)
- **Probe:** "What would it take to earn back your business?"
- **Commit:** "Here's what I'm willing to do..."

**The Close:**
"Can we agree to [specific recovery plan] and check in [specific date]?"

### 3. The Strategy Pivot Conversation
**When the current approach isn't working**

**The Setup:**
"Our current strategy isn't delivering results. We need to make a change."

**The Framework:**
- **Reality:** "Here's what the data shows..."
- **Options:** "Here are our alternatives..."
- **Decision:** "I believe we should..."
- **Concerns:** "What concerns do you have?"
- **Commitment:** "Can everyone commit to this new direction?"

**The Close:**
"We're changing direction as of [date]. Everyone needs to be aligned or speak up now."

### 4. The Personnel Change Conversation
**When someone needs to be moved or removed**

**The Setup:**
"We need to discuss your role and where you can best contribute."

**The Framework:**
- **Appreciation:** "I value what you've contributed..."
- **Reality:** "The role requires skills in [specific areas]..."
- **Observation:** "I'm seeing gaps in [specific examples]..."
- **Options:** "We can either [option A] or [option B]..."
- **Decision:** "I think the best path is..."

**The Close:**
"This change happens [date]. Let's discuss how to make this transition successful."

### 5. The Initiative Overload Conversation
**When too many projects are diluting focus**

**The Setup:**
"We have 12 initiatives but our main KPI is declining. We need to refocus."

**The Framework:**
- **List:** All current initiatives
- **Score:** Rate 1-10 impact on biggest problem
- **Cut:** Everything below 7
- **Focus:** Top 3 only
- **Timeline:** When we'll revisit paused items

**The Close:**
"Effective immediately, we're only working on [top 3]. Everything else stops."

## The Meeting Scoring System

### Making Every Conversation Count

**After Every Leadership Meeting, Each Participant Rates:**

1. **Clarity (1-10):** How clear were the decisions?
2. **Resolution (1-10):** Did we solve real problems?
3. **Honesty (1-10):** Did we address the real issues?
4. **Action (1-10):** Do we have clear next steps?
5. **Overall (1-10):** How effective was this meeting?

**Scoring Interpretation:**
- **8-10:** Excellent - maintain this standard
- **6-7:** Acceptable - identify improvement areas
- **4-5:** Poor - immediate changes needed
- **<4:** Crisis - external facilitation recommended

**The Rule:** Any meeting scoring <6 requires immediate debrief on why

## The Conflict Driver Role

### Designating Your Truth Teller

**Who Should Be the Conflict Driver:**
- Usually COO or Integrator
- NOT the visionary/CEO (they ramble)
- Someone comfortable with tension
- Respected by the team
- Has authority to enforce decisions

**Their Responsibilities:**
1. Force resolution on every raised issue
2. Call out avoidance behavior
3. Ensure everyone's voice is heard
4. Document all decisions
5. Follow up on commitments

**Their Authority:**
- Can extend meetings until resolution
- Can call special sessions for unresolved issues
- Can escalate patterns to CEO/Board
- Can require written proposals for complex issues

**Their Protection:**
- Cannot be punished for raising hard truths
- Has CEO's explicit backing
- Regular 1:1 with CEO on team dynamics
- Bonus tied to meeting effectiveness scores

## Common Patterns & Solutions

### Pattern: "We've Talked About This Before"
**Solution:** Ban discussing without resolving. Either solve it or stop mentioning it.

### Pattern: "That's Above My Pay Grade"
**Solution:** If it affects your area, you must have an opinion. Share it.

### Pattern: "Let's Take This Offline"
**Solution:** No. If it affects the group, resolve it with the group.

### Pattern: "I Don't Want to Throw Anyone Under the Bus"
**Solution:** It's not personal. It's about fixing problems, not blame.

### Pattern: "Let's See How It Goes"
**Solution:** No. Set specific checkpoints and success criteria now.

## Scripts for Common Situations

### When Someone's Avoiding:
"I notice we keep mentioning [issue] but not resolving it. Let's solve it now."

### When It Gets Personal:
"Let's separate the person from the problem. How do we fix the process?"

### When There's Disagreement:
"We have different views. Let's list pros/cons and make a decision."

### When Someone's Silent:
"[Name], you're closest to this. What's your perspective?"

### When Time's Running Out:
"We can't leave without resolution. Should we extend or schedule an emergency session?"

## The Bottom Line

Every business has difficult conversations it needs to have. The difference between thriving and dying companies isn't the absence of problems - it's the speed and courage with which they're addressed.

**Your Choice:**
- Have the conversation now when it's uncomfortable
- Have it later when it's a crisis
- Never have it and watch your business fail

**Remember:** The conversation you're avoiding is costing you more than the discomfort of having it.
