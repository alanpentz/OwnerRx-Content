# The $5M Breakthrough Playbook
*The Second-Stage Transition: From Owner-Hero to Systematic Scale*

## Executive Summary

You're stuck at $2-3M because you're still operating like an extended startup instead of a second-stage business. This playbook provides the exact sequence, metrics, and systems that separate businesses that break through to $5M from the 70% that plateau forever.

**The Second-Stage Reality:** You have 10-99 employees and need to transition from owner-as-technician to owner-as-leader. This isn't about working harder—it's about building the infrastructure that enables scale without heroics.

**The Promise:** Follow this 90-day sprint methodology, and you'll have the foundation to reach $5M within 12-18 months. Skip steps, and you'll join the 70% stuck at their current level.

## The Second-Stage Business Framework

### What Changes at Second-Stage (10-99 employees, $1-50M potential)

**From Startup Mode:**
- Owner does everything
- Heroic efforts save the day
- Relationships drive sales
- Quality depends on owner oversight
- Cash management by bank balance
- Decisions made by gut

**To Second-Stage Systems:**
- Owner coaches and guides
- Systems ensure consistency  
- Process drives sales
- Quality built into operations
- Cash forecasted 13 weeks out
- Decisions driven by data

### The Three Critical Transitions

1. **Sales Transition:** Owner moves from only closer to sales leader
2. **Operations Transition:** From daily firefighting to systematic delivery
3. **Leadership Transition:** From doing the work to coaching others

**Universal Business Insight #156: Second-Stage Syndrome**
> The skills that got you to $2M (hustle, personal relationships, technical expertise) become the barriers to $5M. The transition requires letting go of what made you successful.

## PHASE 1: THE REVENUE ENGINE (Weeks 1-4)
*Build sales that don't require you*

### Week 1: Speed-to-Lead Implementation

**The MIT Research Reality:** Responding to leads in ≤5 minutes makes you 100x more likely to connect and 21x more likely to qualify. After 30 minutes, leads are essentially dead.

**Day 1-2: Audit Current Response Time**
```
Current State Assessment:
□ Average lead response time: _____ minutes/hours
□ % of leads responded to <5 min: ____%
□ % of leads never responded to: ____%
□ Lead sources tracked: Yes/No
```

**Day 3-4: Implement Instant Response**
1. **Phone System Setup:**
   - Forward all calls to mobile
   - Set up call tracking numbers by source
   - Auto-text if can't answer: "Got your call, returning in 5 min"

2. **Web Form Automation:**
   - Connect forms to SMS alerts
   - Auto-response email within 60 seconds
   - Calendar link for immediate booking

3. **The 5-Minute Protocol:**
   ```
   Lead comes in → Alert fires → Call within 5 min
   If no answer → Text immediately → Email with value
   If contact → Qualify using BANT → Book next step
   ```

**Day 5: Measure and Optimize**
- Track: Time to first contact
- Target: 80% within 5 minutes
- Result: 3-5x increase in contact rate

- See: [Cold Calling Playbook] for qualification scripts

### Week 2: Pipeline Coverage System

**The 3× Rule:** Your pipeline should be 3× your quarterly target to ensure predictable revenue.

**Building Your Pipeline Dashboard:**
```
Pipeline Coverage Calculator:
Next Quarter Target: $______
Current Pipeline Value: $______
Coverage Ratio: ___× (Pipeline ÷ Target)

By Stage:
Prospecting (10% close): $_____
Qualified (25% close): $_____
Proposal (50% close): $_____
Negotiation (75% close): $_____
Weighted Pipeline: $_____
```

**The Weekly Pipeline Review (Level-10 Style):**
1. **Metrics Review (5 min):**
   - New leads this week
   - Pipeline coverage ratio
   - Conversion by stage
   - Average deal size

2. **Deal Review (15 min):**
   - Stuck deals (no movement 2+ weeks)
   - Must-win deals this month
   - At-risk deals needing attention

3. **Action Items (10 min):**
   - Who does what by when
   - Blockers to remove
   - Resources needed

**Link to Existing Content:**
- See: [Sales Pipeline Management] for detailed processes
- See: [CRM Implementation] for tracking setup

### Week 3: Owner Sales Transition

**The Goal:** Owner closes <50% of deals, others can sell independently

**Creating Your Sales Playbook:**
1. **Document Your Sales Process:**
   ```
   Our Sales Process:
   Step 1: Initial Contact (Scripts: ___)
   Step 2: Discovery Call (Questions: ___)
   Step 3: Solution Design (Framework: ___)
   Step 4: Proposal (Template: ___)
   Step 5: Close (Objections: ___)
   ```

2. **Identify Your Sales Leader (Player-Coach):**
   - Current top performer
   - Willing to teach others
   - Can handle key accounts
   - Reports on pipeline weekly

3. **The Transition Timeline:**
   - Week 1-2: Shadow owner on calls
   - Week 3-4: Co-sell with owner
   - Week 5-8: Lead with owner backup
   - Week 9-12: Independent with coaching

**Link to Universal Business Insights:**
> **Universal Business Insight #38: Sales Process Documentation**
> A documented sales process improves close rates by 18% and reduces ramp time by 50%.

### Week 4: Lead Source Diversification

**The Risk:** One dominant lead source = fragility

**Target State:**
- 3+ consistent lead sources
- No source >40% of leads
- Mix of inbound and outbound

**The Diversification Sprint:**
1. **Audit Current Sources:**
   ```
   Lead Source Analysis:
   Source 1: _____ (___% of leads, ___% of revenue)
   Source 2: _____ (___% of leads, ___% of revenue)
   Source 3: _____ (___% of leads, ___% of revenue)
   Concentration Risk: ____%
   ```

2. **Launch Two New Channels:**
   - If referral-heavy → Add paid ads
   - If ad-dependent → Build referral program
   - If inbound-only → Start outbound
   - If local-only → Test digital

- See: [Customer Acquisition Playbook] for implementation

---

## PHASE 2: MARGIN & PRICING DISCIPLINE (Weeks 3-6)
*Profitable enough to fund growth*

### Week 3-4: Gross Labor Rate (GLR) Optimization

**The GLR Formula (for trades/services):**
```
Revenue
- Direct Material Costs
- Direct Labor (including burden)
= Gross Profit After Labor (GLR)

Target: 50-60% for healthy scaling
```

**Why GLR Matters More Than Gross Margin:**
- Shows true profitability after biggest cost (labor)
- Indicates pricing vs. efficiency health
- Predicts capacity to invest in growth

**GLR Improvement Sprint:**

**Day 1-3: Calculate Current GLR**
```
Last Month's GLR Calculation:
Total Revenue: $______
Direct Materials: -$______
Direct Labor: -$______
Burden (taxes, benefits): -$______
= Gross Profit After Labor: $______
GLR%: ____% (Goal: 50-60%)
```

**Day 4-7: Job Costing Implementation**
1. **Turn on job costing for 100% of work:**
   - Materials tracked to jobs
   - Labor hours tracked to jobs
   - Calculate profit by job/project

2. **The Job Profit Report:**
   ```
   Job Profitability Analysis:
   Top 20% Profitable: ___% margin
   Middle 60%: ___% margin
   Bottom 20%: ___% margin (or loss)
   
   Action: Fix or fire bottom 20%
   ```

**Day 8-14: Pricing Power Test**
1. **Raise prices 10% on new customers only**
2. **Track close rate impact**
3. **If close rate stays >25%, make permanent**
4. **If close rate drops, try 5%**

**Link to Existing Content:**
- See: [Pricing Strategy Playbook] for advanced tactics
- See: [Financial Dashboard] for tracking setup

### Week 5-6: Margin Protection Systems

**The Quote-to-Cash Process:**
```
Quote (with margin target) →
Job Costing (track actual) →
Variance Analysis (weekly) →
Price Adjustment (monthly)
```

**The Weekly Margin Review:**
1. **Jobs below target margin - Why?**
   - Underquoted
   - Overdelivered  
   - Inefficiency
   - Rework

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Customer types with low margins
   - Service types with low margins
   - Team members with low margins

3. **Corrective Actions:**
   - Requote similar work higher
   - Reduce scope creep
   - Improve efficiency
   - Train or reassign team

**Universal Business Insight #127: Margin Discipline**
> Companies that track margins weekly are 40% more profitable than those that check monthly or quarterly. Real-time visibility drives better decisions.

---

## PHASE 3: OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE (Weeks 5-8)
*Deliver consistently without heroics*

### Week 5-6: Capacity & Utilization Optimization

**The 70-75% Rule:** Optimal utilization for sustainable growth

**Why 70-75% Is the Sweet Spot:**
- <70%: Inefficient, losing money
- 70-75%: Room for surge, time for improvement
- >75%: No flexibility, quality suffers
- >85%: Burnout imminent, mistakes increase

**Utilization Calculation:**
```
For Service Businesses:
Billable Hours ÷ Available Hours = Utilization %

For Trades:
Scheduled Hours ÷ Available Hours = Utilization %

For Manufacturing:
Production Hours ÷ Available Hours = Utilization %
```

**The Capacity Dashboard:**
```
Weekly Capacity Tracker:
Team Member | Available | Scheduled | Utilization | Target
Person A    | 40 hrs   | 30 hrs    | 75%        | 70-75% ✓
Person B    | 40 hrs   | 36 hrs    | 90%        | 70-75% ⚠️
Person C    | 40 hrs   | 24 hrs    | 60%        | 70-75% ⚠️
```

**Optimization Actions:**
- If <70%: Add more work or reduce capacity
- If >75%: Hire, outsource, or raise prices
- Track weekly, adjust monthly

### Week 7-8: On-Time Delivery System

**The 90% Standard:** Deliver on-time ≥90% or lose reputation

**On-Time Tracking Setup:**
```
On-Time Performance:
Jobs This Week: ___
Delivered On-Time: ___
On-Time %: ___% (Target: ≥90%)

Root Causes of Late Delivery:
□ Poor scheduling (___%)
□ Scope creep (___%)
□ Resource shortage (___%)
□ Quality issues/rework (___%)
□ Customer delays (___%)
```

**The WIP (Work in Progress) Board:**
```
Not Started | In Progress | Review | Complete
-----------|-----------  |--------|----------
Job 123    | Job 456 ⚠️  | Job 789| Job 012
Job 234    | Job 567     | Job 890| Job 123
Job 345    | Job 678 🔴  |        | Job 234

Legend: ⚠️ = At risk, 🔴 = Late
```

**Weekly Operations Review:**
1. Review all late/at-risk jobs

---

## PHASE 4: FINANCIAL CONTROL (Weeks 7-10)
*Know your numbers in real-time*

### Week 7-8: The 10-Day Close

**Why Close Speed Matters:**
- 10-day close = decisions based on current reality
- 30-day close = managing by rearview mirror
- No close = flying blind

**The 10-Day Close Process:**
```
Day 1-3: Gather
□ All invoices entered
□ All expenses coded
□ Bank reconciliation

## PHASE 5: LEADERSHIP RHYTHM (Ongoing)
*Replace heroics with systems*

### The Weekly Level-10 Meeting

**Why Level-10 Works:**
- Same agenda every week (predictability)

```

### The Accountability Chart

**Not an Org Chart—An Accountability Chart**

**The Difference:**
- Org chart shows reporting structure
- Accountability chart shows who owns what
- Functions first, people second
- One person can own multiple functions

**Building Your Accountability Chart:**
```
Function | Accountable Person | KPI Owned
---------|-------------------|----------
Sales | [Name] | Pipeline, Revenue
Marketing | [Name] | Leads, CAC
Operations | [Name] | On-Time, Quality
Finance | [Name] | Cash, Margins
HR/People | [Name] | Turnover, Hiring
Customer Success | [Name] | NPS, Retention
```

**The Three Lite Hires Before C-Suite:**

1. **Sales Manager (Player-Coach)**
   - Carries quota AND manages
   - Runs pipeline reviews
   - Coaches team
   - $60-80K base + commission

2. **Operations Manager**
   - Owns scheduling/capacity
   - Drives on-time delivery
   - Manages quality
   - $50-70K

3. **Controller (Can be Fractional)**
   - Closes books by day 10
   - Manages cash forecast
   - Drives collections
   - $40-60K or $2-3K/month fractional

**Total Investment: ~$150-200K (3-4% of $5M revenue)**
**Return: Owner freed for strategy and growth**

---

## THE BREAKTHROUGH TRUTH

**You already have a $5M business trapped in $3M operations.**

The market is there. The customers want more. Your team could handle it. But you're stuck because you're still operating like it's year one.

The shift from $3M to $5M isn't about finding new customers or working harder. It's about:
- Building systems that scale
- Developing leaders who own outcomes
- Measuring what matters
- Making decisions by data, not gut

**70% of businesses plateau permanently at their current level.**

Not because they can't grow, but because they won't change how they operate.

You now have the exact blueprint used by thousands of businesses that broke through.

**The question isn't whether this works—it does.**

**The question is whether you'll actually do it.**

*Start your 90-day sprint today. In 12-18 months, you'll either be at $5M or still reading playbooks about how to get there.*

**Which will you choose?**
