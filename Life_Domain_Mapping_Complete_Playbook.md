# Life Domain Mapping Complete Playbook
## Balance Your Entire Life, Not Just Your Business

### Executive Summary: The Six Domains That Determine Everything

Most business owners optimize their business while their life falls apart. They win at work and lose at home, build wealth while destroying health, achieve success while sacrificing relationships. This isn't necessary—it's a choice based on poor planning.

**Alan's Core Philosophy:** "Business should serve your life, not the other way around. Map your life domains, understand where you're failing, and restructure your business to support what actually matters."

This playbook shows you how to map, measure, and optimize all six life domains simultaneously, creating sustainable success that doesn't require sacrificing everything else.

## The Six Life Domains

### 1. Health (Physical & Mental)
**What It Really Means:**
- Energy levels throughout the day
- Physical fitness and capability
- Mental clarity and emotional stability
- Sleep quality and recovery
- Stress management effectiveness

**The Business Owner Reality:**
"Your health is your first wealth. Lose it and nothing else matters."

### 2. Relationships (Family & Friends)
**What It Really Means:**
- Quality time with spouse/partner
- Presence with children
- Maintaining friendships
- Extended family connections
- Professional relationships that matter

**Alan's Insight:**
"The divorce rate for entrepreneurs is high because they think they can fix relationships later. You can't."

### 3. Business (Work & Career)
**What It Really Means:**
- Revenue and profit growth
- Market position and reputation
- Team development and culture
- Strategic progress
- Daily operational excellence

**The Trap:**
"Most owners score 9/10 here and 3/10 everywhere else. That's not success—it's addiction."

### 4. Financial (Wealth & Security)
**What It Really Means:**
- Personal wealth accumulation
- Financial independence progress
- Risk management and insurance
- Investment diversification
- Legacy planning

**Alan's Wisdom:**
"You'll double your wealth target when you approach it. Everyone does. Plan for it."

### 5. Personal Growth (Learning & Development)
**What It Really Means:**
- New skills acquisition
- Personal interests and hobbies
- Spiritual or philosophical development
- Creative expression
- Continuous learning

**The Reality:**
"Owners who stop growing personally see their businesses stagnate. The two are linked."

### 6. Recreation (Fun & Recovery)
**What It Really Means:**
- Actual vacation time (not working vacations)
- Hobbies and interests
- Social activities
- Adventure and experiences
- True mental breaks from business

**The Test:**
"If you can't take two weeks off without checking in, you don't have a business—you have an expensive job."

## Implementation by Revenue Stage

### Solo/Bootstrap Stage ($0-1M)
**The Survival Reality**

**Domain Reality:**
- Business dominates everything (70-80% of energy)
- Health and relationships suffer most
- Financial stress is constant
- Recreation seems impossible
- Personal growth limited to business skills

**Rebalancing Strategy:**
- **Non-negotiables**: 7 hours sleep, one date night weekly, 30 minutes daily exercise
- **Time blocking**: Sunday = family, no exceptions
- **Micro-recovery**: 10-minute breaks every 2 hours
- **Financial discipline**: Pay yourself first, even if just $100/month
- **Learning hack**: Podcasts during commute/exercise

**Success Metrics:**
- All domains score minimum 4/10
- One domain improves each quarter
- No domain drops below 3/10

### Resourced Stage ($1M-5M)
**The Growth Trap**

**Domain Reality:**
- Business still dominates (60-70%)
- Money stress decreases but time stress increases
- Health often crashes here ("success weight")
- Relationships strained by growth demands
- Recreation replaced by "business entertainment"

**Rebalancing Strategy:**
- **Hire for freedom**: First hire = buy back your time
- **Energy management**: Do energy audit, delegate draining tasks
- **Relationship investment**: Quarterly couple retreats, weekly family dinners
- **Health systems**: Personal trainer, meal prep service
- **Real vacations**: One week quarterly, truly offline

**Alan's $2M Insight:**
"At $2M, the hub-and-spoke model breaks. Hire management or burn out—choose."

**Success Metrics:**
- All domains minimum 5/10
- No more than 50 hours/week working
- One full week vacation per quarter

### Scaled Stage ($5M+)
**The Leadership Challenge**

**Domain Reality:**
- Business should need you less (40-50% energy)
- Financial domain strong but others may atrophy
- Identity crisis common ("Who am I without the business?")
- Relationships need rebuilding
- Health requires intentional focus

**Rebalancing Strategy:**
- **Leadership team**: Build team that runs without you
- **Identity expansion**: Develop interests beyond business
- **Relationship repair**: Invest heavily in neglected relationships
- **Health optimization**: Executive physicals, preventive care
- **Contribution focus**: Board positions, mentoring, philanthropy

**Success Metrics:**
- All domains minimum 7/10
- Business runs 30 days without you
- Four weeks vacation annually

## The Domain Mapping Process

### Step 1: Baseline Assessment (Week 1)

**Rate Each Domain (1-10):**
- 1-3: Crisis/Emergency
- 4-6: Struggling/Unstable
- 7-8: Good/Satisfactory
- 9-10: Excellent/Optimal

**Document Evidence:**
For each score, write three specific examples that justify the rating.

**Time Audit:**
Track actual hours spent in each domain for one week.

### Step 2: Gap Analysis (Week 2)

**Identify Crisis Domains:**
Anything scoring <4 needs immediate intervention.

**Calculate Balance Score:**
Standard deviation of all scores. Lower = better balance.

**Time vs. Satisfaction Mismatch:**
Where are you spending time without getting satisfaction?

### Step 3: Vision Setting (Week 3)

**Define Success for Each Domain:**
Write one paragraph describing what 9/10 looks like.

**Set Minimum Acceptable Standards:**
Below what score is unacceptable?

**Create Non-Negotiables:**
What must happen weekly in each domain?

### Step 4: Integration Planning (Week 4)

**Design Ideal Week:**
Block time for each domain proportional to importance.

**Create Systems:**
What recurring activities support each domain?

**Identify Conflicts:**
Where do domains compete? How to resolve?

## Alan's Final Wisdom on Life Domains

"Most business owners sacrifice their entire life for their business, thinking they'll fix everything 'later.' But later never comes. Your spouse gets tired of waiting. Your kids grow up without you. Your health fails when you finally have time to enjoy success.

The answer isn't balance—it's integration. Build a business that supports your life domains, not one that destroys them. 

At $2M, if you're still the hub in a hub-and-spoke model, you're going to burn out. Hire management. Create systems. Build a business that runs without you being there 70 hours a week.

Your domains will never be perfectly balanced. That's fine. But they should all be above your minimum acceptable standards. No domain should be in crisis while another is at 10/10.

Remember: You can always make more money. You can't make more time. And you definitely can't buy back the relationships, health, and experiences you sacrifice for business success.

Map your domains. Know your minimums. Protect what matters. The business that destroys your life isn't success—it's failure with money."

**Remember:** Your business is just ONE of six life domains. Optimize all six, or success in one won't matter.
