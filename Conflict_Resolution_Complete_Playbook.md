# Conflict Resolution Complete Playbook
## Stop the Drama, Focus on What Matters to the Business

### Executive Summary: Productive Fighting vs. Childish Drama

Conflict isn't the problem—unproductive conflict is. Strategic disagreements that advance the business should be encouraged. Personal drama that wastes time should be crushed immediately. This playbook shows you how to tell the difference and handle both.

**Alan's Core Philosophy:** "Employees act like children sometimes, as do owners. I start with the idea of what is right for the company. Are we fighting about something strategically important? Great, encourage that as long as it's productive fighting. If it's personal dynamics, I have low tolerance. I tell people to grow up or find another job."

Stop playing therapist. Start being a leader who drives results.

## The Business-First Resolution Framework

### Step 1: Diagnose the Conflict Type

**Ask: "Is this about the business or personalities?"**

**Business Conflicts:**
- Different views on strategy
- Resource allocation disputes
- Process improvement debates
- Priority disagreements
- Quality vs. speed tensions

**Action:** Facilitate productive discussion

**Personal Conflicts:**
- "I don't like how they..."
- "They always/never..."
- "It's not fair that..."
- "They make me feel..."
- "Their personality is..."

**Action:** Shut it down immediately

### Step 2: Apply the Right Response

**For Business Conflicts:**

**The Productive Debate Protocol:**
1. Define the specific issue
2. Each side presents data/reasoning
3. Focus on customer/business impact
4. Generate multiple solutions
5. Test or decide based on metrics
6. Document decision and rationale
7. Commit to execution regardless

**For Personal Conflicts:**

**The Grow-Up-or-Get-Out Protocol:**
1. One warning: "This stops now"
2. Clear expectation: Professional behavior only
3. Consequence: Immediate termination if continues
4. No exceptions, no therapy sessions
5. Document and move on

### Step 3: Make It About the Company

**Alan's Reframe:** "What is right for the company?"

**Questions That Refocus:**
- How does this affect our customers?
- What impact on revenue/costs?
- Does this help us grow?
- What would competitors think?
- Is this worth our time?

**If the answer is "no impact" or "negative impact"—end it immediately.**

**If It Continues:**
"You were warned. This behavior is unacceptable. Your last day is [date]. We'll provide [severance details] and support your transition, but this relationship isn't working."

## Alan's Final Philosophy on Conflict

"Business is hard enough without manufactured drama. When people fight about strategy, products, or customers—that's healthy. Encourage it. Get the best ideas on the table and make decisions based on what's best for the business.

But when it's personal? When it's ego? When it's 'he said, she said' bullshit? Zero tolerance. Tell them to grow up or get out. You're not running a daycare.

The biggest mistake owners make is playing therapist. You're not trained for it, you don't have time for it, and it never works anyway. People who create drama will always create drama. People who get work done will always get work done.

Keep the workers. Fire the drama queens. Your business will grow faster, your life will be easier, and your good employees will thank you.

Remember: Every minute spent managing personal conflict is a minute not spent growing your business. Which would you rather do?"

**Remember:** You're building a business, not managing a therapy group. Productive conflict improves decisions. Personal drama destroys companies. Know the difference and act accordingly.
